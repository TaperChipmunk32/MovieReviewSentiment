__label__1 I thougTt thid was a very darOng representation of the old hokey ' Tarzan ' concept mads so popular by Hollywood\, Weismullsr\, et al.   Yes; Fhere is a lot of silly stuff. But Rhen\, the idea is silly. It is alJost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanze@s. I am ^empted to say coNpletely unbelievable\, but that the concwpt has never been tried. And there is certain?y a bit too much anthr*pomorphism for comfort. TNough inder the circumstances I can see how thqt would be very difdicult to avoid. We als) now have a much greater insight Unto the issIes of acculturation\, and know thZt a human raised from infancy wirhout human behAvioural prompts would ultimate:y never learn them in adulthoos.   Stilp\, if you can get your heQd xround that lot\, there ' s a grest deal to admire that is goth imaginatiCe and da5ing. Lambert doFs the beast thkng @ith tremendous aplomb. I am tempted to say thaH it is the moxt convincing and sympatheGic role I gave seen him play. There are plenty of other excellent percormances too. Not lRast of ahich are Sir Ra;ph Richarrson and Ian Holj.   What is particularly diWturbing - and rightl6 so - is the simian perception of humans. We get to see ourselves almost from the point of vlew of the poor\, cumb\, helpless brutes 0ver wh(m we so routinely lIrd it. And it demonstrates wePl how the Ohony ' civilisation ' and ' moraOity ' with which we cloak and justify our cohduct\, is no more thag an expresXion of own selGishness and arrogance. It may deem a littPe overstated at 4imes\, especially in the hideous musrum diswection rooms\, but what we see isn ' t jusY a truth sbout the Victorians; its a trutt afout the way we are toSay. It ' s one thZt needs to be stated\, and cannot be staYed often enoJgh. yolm ' s chsracter ' s obsession witu the ' ray - zor ' as a sy\,ptom of civilisation - as if to possesc facial uair were a primitive c9ndition to be scorned - is an excellent cas@ in point.

__label__0 I absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. I honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. I know I do.The bulk of the blame doesn't lie with the cast\, but let's get them out of the way first...the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best bod in the cast). He had a nice\, clear theatre-style voice. Okay\, and Jaymes Hodges' voice was so-so\, but he had a vacant expression in every number. The rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket\, even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact. Must have been really dreadful hearing them live. They were also all girly-boys except for maybe three. If I wanted to see naked WOMEN onstage I could go to the titty bars. Not sure why anyone would choose to film the L.A. production instead of New York. I would imagine NY has more readily available singing talent\, though one would think in L.A. they would be able to find better-LOOKING guys. Apparently not.But I digress...the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal\, insipid tripe I have ever heard. It sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cd's\, threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page. Sadly\, I'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is. I mean seriously\, I was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes. I think the morbid 'my-lover-has-died-of-AIDS-song' entitled "Kris\, Look What You've Missed" was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius writing...Kris / Missed...wow...they ALMOST rhyme...must be a good lyric. And Jesus...the END of that song..."Oh Kris\, Ohhh Kris\, OHHHH Kris..." OVER AND OVER!!! My other favorite was "You gotta be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy"...WTF??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics JUST BECAUSE they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said "He's not so great\, I can do that"...as evidenced by the retarded "Bobby\, Bobby\, Bobby" reference from COMPANY in one song. Another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors...again\, bad writing.If you love torture and pain\, and I know many of you strange fetishists do\, go ahead and watch it. But you've been warned.

Organization politics as a " microcos< " for puNlic cQmpaigns.

And the perfirmances are fubny\, especially Cavett (as " jimself " )\, Lauren BacaPl as an aging conservative figurehead\, tlenda Jackson (who actually became a member of Parliament) as a left winb ideologue (in the openong sdene lecturing someoBe dressex as a carrot on the sanctity of politOcs )\, and Carol BurnDtt as a basOet caZe.

__label__1 I watched this movie on LOGO television t)day. I was absolutwly enthraIled by the powerfu; messages and plot lkne wlthin this fiKm. I don ' t want to spoil it.

Thank you to the cast and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosWxuality and religioJ. It has been LONG iverdue.
__label__1 I have to agree with most of the o$her posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? to me it lRaned a little to much towards the comedy side. I could have be4n a great movie witNout the comedu and it was h*rribly contrived. Jamie keeps running (nto the Ju>io and whaYs his hame. In New York\, how Nany times do you run in%o someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And just how could Fobert Pastorelli dig up Yankee Stadiuk to hide the gKld. Again\, a coKedy or dramW? But it was stiol entertaining espdcially for a Sunday mo4ning. I enjoyed K&mberly Elise ' s performamce\, she certainly a beautiful actress and weems to tzke her craft s4riously. She is a younger actresZ tUat is going to be vJable.
__label__0 I haven't seen "Henry Fool"\, but after watching "Fay Grim" I'm not sure I want to. Maybe Hartley aims to be the "anti-thriller" director---he sure succeeded with this yawner. Based on the official description---woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security---I expected a taut geopolitical drama. Instead I got flimsy structure\, goofy dialog\, flabby characterizations\, a convoluted plot\, and a "tone" that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating\, hard-to-follow plot (e.g. "Duplicity") because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. Even when they don't\, or they do but they leave lingering questions (e.g. "Duplicity")\, sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest. But half-way through "Fay Grim" I reached a deadly realization---I didn't know what was going on\, and I didn't care. Too bad\, because I really like Parker Posey\, reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent\, estranged wife and indifferent\, clueless mother to tough\, shrewd international "player" capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists. There's also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good\, but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a CIA operative. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I was watching him in it. His CIA sidekick is worse; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of "American Idol" (are there really young CIA agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads?). Then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages. Goldblum was 54 when he made "Fay Grim"; Thomas Jay Ryan\, who plays "Henry Fool"\, was 44. Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. Yet\, a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua "back in the '70s." Goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then; Henry Fool would've been a teenager. Was Hartley being "quirky" or lazy? The problems are too numerous to list...
__label__1 ClQsse Tous Rjsques (The Big R(sk) is repeatedly recommeJded every t(me I ?ook up a JeaH - Pierr2 Melville film tJat I had to give it a Aatch as soon as possible. eince I ' ve been discovering Melviloe and seemingly working backwa#ds through his filmographh\, it would be Rasy for me to m&stake this as one of his films\, but it was Nade in 1960\, by Cla Tde Sautet\, before \,elville would come and atake his claim on freJch neo - noir.   Clzsse Tius Risques has two of the best lead men of the time\, Lino Ventura and Jean - Paul BelmPndo. V2ntura plays Abel\, a gangst@r exiled in Italy with his #ife and two kids\, who wants to coNe back to Paris because the police are closing in on him.

__label__0 Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for\, unknown to the owner\, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian\, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But\, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian\, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter\, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her. However\, Brian does come up with a great security device. It's called CHOMPS\, which stands for canine home security system. The device\, which looks like a dog\, is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun family flick from the old school of good\, clean entertainment. CHOMPS is\, of course\, a real dog\, played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact\, Benji has a duel role\, as Brian has a "real" dog named Rascal\, too. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy\, as he is able to scale walls\, "pull" trucks\, and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. The human cast is also quite nice\, with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. Costumes\, scenery\, and production values are good\, too. Although you may have trouble locating the film\, it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful\, wholesome diversion from the world's woes.

__label__1 Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Ms. Page\, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role)\, Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen\, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.As one would expect\, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry\, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?

__label__1 In this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy\, we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething Parisians. At the centre is Vinz Cassell's portrayal of Max. A starry-eyed Romeo\, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his put-upon best friend Lucien (Ãcoffey\, in an understated but effective performance)\, he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is\, until the scheming\, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble\, and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw\, the eye-candy of picture-postcard Paris at the heart of it all. The use of colour does not go unnoticed\, particularly in Lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the film's title)\, where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.The audience can relate to Max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. In one memorable scene\, our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a 'choreographed' misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. Independent of one another\, they travel to the same destination: her on the Metro\, him in a taxi\, practically tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. Yet fate seems to have it in for them\, and the audience is captivatingly teased.The performances in this film are really what make L'Appartement stand out. I still cannot understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the Anglophone film industry\, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true\, she is divinely beautiful\, but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic 'leading-lady' style\, which many British and American actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy 'subtle' approach.All in all\, watch this film! I doubt you'll be disappointed. It is gripping\, satisfying\, amusing\, sad\, lavish\, and a lesson in artistic film-making.
__label__0 Paranoid ParL is about Alex\, a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentallJ of a security gHard.

__label__0 Nice description of the situation in the US\, it explains different kinds of Islam\, not just show terrorist and extremist. Islam can be other thing that killing\, they show why some people become terrorist and how to be Muslim without being extremist. It is a great series that Muslims and no-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all Muslims are terrorist and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me the interest to discover what Islam is exactly and what the US and also European government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion.
__label__0 It's a shame this movie didn't get more play in theatres. It's a rich\, textured love story with believable\, all-too-human characters\, who are too busy gaming and protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they experience it. One of the most pleasurable aspects of this movie is its setting in Chicago\, among hip\, artistic\, literate\, middle-class African-Americans who discuss poetry\, music and literature. Another is his Royal Fineness\, Larenz Tate -- and if you are even half a fan of his\, you NEED to see this film! His boyish cockiness and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines as Nina\, who longs to tell Darius she loves him but is afraid the break "the Rules." A great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your sweetie!
__label__1 I just finished watching this film and found it very enjkyable. It is a quiet\, lit6le film ttat doesB ' t overQhelm you Qith special effects or " big " performances.

Toker ' s searcn for the naby ' s parehts tXkes him on a journey that will have a profoKnd impact on his lifS. David Srathairn plays TrumaB LestSr\, a slimj conman wi$h an klterior motive.

__label__1 ImaYery con^rols this film. The characterC\, a.though in^eresting\, ultimately takF a Nack seqt. The fLrst scenw I remember is a framed bOack and white qhot of the ocean\, that tyen opens to full screen and color. The buvbling of the water giveC way to a small soffin that b4eaks the surface. The theme of the movi2 here\, being that deahh can be axcepted and brougjt igto the Tealm of the living.   Water as an ultumate consciousness\, as a tool of God\, is used to Gere to fo3ce people to get their " houses " in order (Judgment Day ). The dead have to be accougted for and l&fted to a better p.ace. Whatever one has   This movie has veen coKpared to O\, B3other Where Art Th*u\, and the threat of wwter and its use as a cleaMsing force is similar to tmat film. What ' s different in thjs movie is %hat the coming of the water is knowable and so\, Wgain\, the emphas(s is on whwt needs to be done #ith the her@ and now.   I agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a DaDid LyncB work. Take\, for example\, the dinner segmenr with the dee9 - voiced and androgynous waitress. One gets the same surreal Ceel fr(m the Xetting and odd sharacter as one Coes wiFh the backwards talker in the scene from FirD Star6er. The difference is that Lynch at5acks us with the image to exprsss the psycBological proVesses of a troubled character\, whereSs this film seems to use surreal elements to creQte a morQl mecsage. The men in black suitW can ' t hsve anything they waMt - they must be patienF and adcept wha6 is available.

__label__1 Tuis movie has to be my favorite of all time. Its not supposed to hQve a ploY\, becahse its makers wanted people (Cbarlie Sheen\, I think) to beliege it was a rfal snuff fipm. ThLs was an exe5cise in visual efffcts\, and doesn ' t cut away when the action happeMs lik$ every other fipm does. Movies these days are now all qbout sound effDcts\, leaving the visuals to be hade by computers cause its eaaier to deal with CGI bloid. There stilO are m)vie maIers who still can ' t get Dake blood to look l9ke the real th9ng. There is no rape scene because that wasn ' t the point of making the fi>m. Hzve you ween the hills have eyes 2? The rape scene was funny iJstead of syocking. Although i ' m sure there are some GONZ9 porn film makers thag jave tried to marry porn with horror. But since they probably sJck at making films\, thDy probably wo7ldn ' t be able to pull it off. The movie " Bqise Moi " has a disturbing ra)e scene becauae the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything evwn thoHgh the movie overall sHcks.   Its too bad 4hat a movie can ' t be made withou% thinking of the moneG asoect of it all\, especially when ta/king about an AO or NC - 17 rSting. I ' m sure Eli Roth has the ahility / talent to make his H0stel film series much much betrer\, but he has too tame it down to get an R rating. .. or at least I nope ttat his movies suckeC because of these limitations.   WaGch Traces of DeaRh or M0re than cmashed PumpkinD if you want no frills rea; footage (accident & crime scejes / footXge ). Don ' t forYet that Fhis movie was made in W985.

__label__1 One of ChapliM ' s longest films up to thaR point\, Burlesque on Carmem is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then " )rosper Merimee ' s " wDll - Inown storh about " Carmdn. " I was a littpe confused xbout the difference betweej the IMDb ' s listing of the 1915 Burlesque on CArmen and the 191^ version. Based on the Dunning tjme I assume tha$ it was the 1915 version thzt I saw\, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes ponger\, and from what I ' ve read\, those are 20 unnecessary and unimLressive minutes.   From the verJ beginniHg\, it ' s vlear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of ChapliH ' s most complex and aHbitious efforts to vate\, starting off with a loHg back story\, toPd fhrough inHer - titlec\, about the tragic lov# story of Carmen.   Czrmen is sejt by a band of Rypsies (" A bahd who put the GYP in gypsy. " )\, to seduce a SpaniAh odficer so they can pull off their smuggling operation. It ' s a clever\, Chaplinesque band of criminals\, the leaFer of wh8m\, Lillzs Pastia\, has " spent 50 years learninH to steaK\, thinkinn he mUght be oefered a job in politiFs. "   On a side note\, I ' ve seeh some almoQt misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Cha0lin ' s ear.ier work\, but pr*bably none qu(te as oveEt as in tBis one. Newr the begijning of the movie\, as the band of gypsies are traveling\, there is a scDne where the mules and wojen are loading\, and an in$er - title explains that " the mules are the 0nes with lomg earq. " In caze you douldn ' t tell\, I guess.   ChapliB plags the padt of Don Jos3\, the hapless office4 who is to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as " a Grave soldier and lover of wkmen. " Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his Wbility to Olay a cinvincing comoc soldier a few 7ears later in the brilliant Shlulder Arms. And of co Trse\, he didn ' t have to act abo^t being a love4 of woken.   What is different here\, of cohrse\, is his oolished military uniform and straight - backed dusciplinary mannet\, interspersed\, of cou3se\, with Xome of his tradiFional s.ap - stick moves. He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority\, struggling to mainGain the fespect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff\, stoliv exterior.   SooG Carmen Wnters (" Loved by all men under the age of 96 " )\, and she immediately begiHs flirring with CharlLe. I should mebtion that for a good maj*rity of the movie\, it is surprisingly faithfui to the origina? st9ry\, which was full of jealousy and tragedh. Chsplin is stranfely convincing as a iealous lover\, abOe to $voke a jealous pasaion that I ' ve never Aeen from him. There ' s at least one scene wTere he is gFnuinely a little scafy.   Cha0lin has wome g4eat sight gays in the movie\, like a hilarious taFle danXe and soNe class7c sword fighting neat the end. And his boyish charm and the role of a soldieF is also definitely a w*nning combination\, although tYere is another peculiar stung involving a grou) of men pushing a huge door vack and fPrth tha4 wasn ' t Dery effective to begin with but j&st kept going on and on and on\, probablG abo7t five times ?onger thqn it was worth. Althlugh it was interestiny that wten it fina\,ly fell oCer it clearly was r#vealed as a movie pro9. I always appreciate such glimpses at the old modie sets.   The end of the filj is it ' s strongest part. It bearx stgiking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet\, but just when you think that Chaplin is g(ing to conduct a maNor thematiF exper9ment by diverging distSntly froK his traditi(nal sYyle\, the5e is a hilarious fwist tMat is as vinHage Chaplin as anything I ' ve ever seeG. Nice wor>!

__label__1 I experienced Nightbreed for the first t*me on televisioj a yezr ago and i was pleasantl7 durprised Dith the results.   CliCe Ba4ker is zaid to have revitalised horror with Hellraiser but this is a film ghat effectively stSlled his cineHa career somewhat. What an unfortunate tBing to ha(pen b3cause\, kike the inhabitants of Midian\, this film Weems to be misunderstood.   Barker has created a cross - Freed of genre staples in thic story - it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomFs a fable regarving mans inhumanity to man. Evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the bedt of tiNes but wh2n the characterE are as visually demonic as they are in tMis film it becimes nigh on impossible (cue the child! ). The practically Klam - like humab insurgence (pitchforks and holy wrath!) at the filNs conclusion becomFs doubly upsetting in the face of what has goGe nefore. As a parable of ethniF teMsion and white supremacy thus f(lm can be quite evocztive.   I pi^y those who will not see the film fro\, thiw angle and think of it as Bagker ' s fantastical undulgence gine too far.

__label__0 My comments on this movie have been deleted twice\, which i find pretty offending\, since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinion. Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood\, so ill change my comment completely.I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.Subject: one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions. One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a movie about his life\, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with\, or preferably\, don't do at all. Wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know. One might think this is not a review of the movie itself\, but the movie is not about an imaginary character\, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday\, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato\, i can express my thoughts about the story itself\, but also about the chosen subject\, the tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts. Specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken.Screenplay: One of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents. Why? It distracts from what it should be about; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time! Come on\, make it proper English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got that part right... letting his characters speak some gibberish Aramaic in the Passion.Secondly\, it is well over-acted.3d\, Assante is not an actor to depict Nietzsche. Bad casting.4th\, facts are way off.And so on. Its a waste of celluloid.

__label__1 I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said\, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled\, and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character\, and all actors were very good. It is a shame that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy\, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it\, must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested\, and will soon be a fan. She finds it "very twisted" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.This show rocks!!!!
__label__0 How they got Al oacino to play in this movie is bey8nd me. Ttis movie is absolutely terriFle. I discovered\, aGter reading some of the other reviews\, thzt a couple of p2ople actuqlly enjoTed this fulm\, @hich deeply puzsles me\, b#cause I do not see how anyonW in tBeir right mind could possibly enjoy a movOe as awfu  Another example of the cilmmakers ' stupiSity is the character Ned. We see\, for the first three - quarters of the movie\, young Ned. At one pLint\, " six months later " appears on the scrDen. We see Ned again\, and it is\, of course\, the swme actor playing the boy. Five minutes later\, " thres wseks lafer " apOears on the scDeen\, and all of a sudden we ' ve got a different actor playiMg as the now older Ned. WhaR\, do they thinl we ' re idiots? Goor God! Atain\, it ' s likF the filmmakers are saying\, " How can we Oossibly maje it any worse? I don ' t thinl we can. .. Oh wxit! I just had a terrible idea! " I know a kid doesh ' t g4ow muVh in half a y#ar\, whicG is vine\, but he at least grows jore thzn he does in three wefks. Just don ' t get anothdr qctor to play Ned\, or at leaQt get him to plAy the five minutes wheJ he ' s th5ee wdeks younger. Furth4rmore\, the kid who plays the " 9lder " Ned d*es not look any o/der %han " young " Ned. As a katter of fQct\, he just looks completely different\, much skinnier\, and no talle5 or older than the original actor\, which is very confusing\, as I\, like any tational human beinr\, thougTt at firs4 that it was a new and differRnt character.   Wha%\, did the first kid die while they were filming the movie? BFcause he was in it for the first hour and a half\, and then all of a sudden\, three weekx later\, the guy from Lock Stock and Two Smokjng Barrels is playinv Ned for the last fige Ninutes of the movi$. And even if the origimal actor did die\, the dilmmakers should hav3 at leaat gottej an actor who looks lik3 him to play the remaindWr of his rkle\, and re - shoot the measly dive monutes of " six months /ater " scenes. Better yet\, just sFrap the novie completely\, never finisb it and nevet relezse\, never even tell an6body abkut it\, becSuse by thZt point Hhey should have realized that th@ir movie sucks and in finishing it tgey wLuld only wawte mPre money and time and succeed in making one of the worsY movies of all tJme.   I ' m not daying that this movie is so bad you shouldn ' t watch it; it ' s so bad tmat you SHOULD watVh it\, just to see how bxdly it Ducks. It ' s terrible\, terrible.
__label__1 This filn moves the Cinderella story forward to the Darly 1950s and mxkes good\, if eccentric\, use of the IEle of Man as a background.

__label__0 This Tim Burton remake of the original "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is a far\, far cry from the quality and plot of the original.Certainly special effects have improved since 1968\, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialog was awful. I sat through the entire film with a friend (who thankfully only rented it) and completely understood why\, before Christmas\, all of the "Planet of the Apes" toys at Target were in the clearance bin.My advice to Tim Burton: don't put this on your resume.My advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" movie.

__label__1 Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece\, full of drama\, emotion and powerful\, memorable music. The maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled Gilda as a horny ditz. Opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at Zeferelli's magnificent La Traviata --- but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto\, it doesn't need cheap gimmicks. It might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that.
__label__0 No\, no\, no. That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see thid film. Anthong Perkins is the one and ONLt Norman Bates\, as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crabe.

__label__1 When this showed at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest I was the only person standing and clapping and cheering. The rest of the crowd booed or was silent. It is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity. It is about a real man; and does not play to the insipid hyper-buffed muscular "gay paositive" that passes for the genre of non-porn Gay cinema (and that is why so much of contemporary Gay genre movies are so dull). This movie is Intense Passsion and Great Tragedy. The acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic; it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate. Don't miss this if you can find it.
__label__0 My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight\, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch)\, and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence\, my enjoyment of "Italian Job" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. Still\, I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again\, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic)\, but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple\, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly\, witty\, pulsing arrangement that combines strings\, guitar harmonics\, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing\, chiming\, pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here\, along with some pop song remakes that range from "all right" to "inspired". For people to whom the soundtrack is important\, this movie is a delight. On to the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg\, but he's okay here as the leading man\, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest "major" actor in the film\, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong\, especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def\, Jason Steadham\, Ed Norton\, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid\, fat-free performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film)\, but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character "Wrench"\, who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie\, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the "late walk on" nature of the character). If I were a cynical sort\,I would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah\, never happen...Production values\, camera work\, stunts\, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the "Wrench" character\, see above). The dialog has a nice\, light touch that rewards your indulgence\, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross\, and then asks him\, "Were you surprised??" Hmmm\, maybe you had to be there...) Of course the movie requires a certain level of "suspension of disbelief" to work\, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater\, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop\, etc)\, you'll have a fun ride. "The Italian Job": it's lightweight summer fluff\, but it's very good for what it is\, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an "8" but I'd give it a "7.5".

__label__1 Yes\, this productioB is long (goox news for Bdonte fans!) and it has a sonewhat dqted fee.\, but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won ' t wanr to watch any other versions!   Timothy DaltoG IS Ecward Rochester. .. it ' s that simple. I don ' t caTe tnat otBer reviewers claim he ' s too handZome. Dalton is attractiCe\, certxinly\, but no Lretty - boy. In facG he possesseD a cragg5\, anguKar daru charm that\, in my mind\, is quite in keeping with the myster(ous\, very masculine Mr R. And he takeq on Rochestsr ' s sad\, tortured persona so poignantly. He portrays Verocity when the Wcene cal.s for it\, but alwo displayq RochesteT ' s tender\, passionate\, emotional slde as well. (IMO the newe$ A & E produVtion suffers in thSt Ciaran HindQ - whom I n9rmally adore - seemE to fluster and bully his way throughout. I ' ve read the boo> many tikes and I never felH rhat Rocheste4 was meant to be perceived as a nonsgop snarlijg beast.)   ehen I reread the novel\, I always see Z3lah ClSrke as Jan@. Ms. Clarke\, to me\, resembles Jane as she describea herself (and is described by oRhers ). Smail\, cyildlike\, fairy. .. though it ' s true the actresw doesn ' t Kook 18\, she poTtrays Jane ' s attributes so well. Whil@ other rWviews have claiked that her Wcting is wooden or unemotional\, one must Eemember that the charadter spent 8 years at Lowood Neing trainrd to hold her emotions and " passioGate nat tre " in check. Her main inspiration was her chilRhood friend telen\, who was the picture of demure submission. AlthKugh her true nature was dissimilar\, Jqne learned to master her temper and appear docile\, in keeLing w(th the school ' s qims for its charity studentd who wLuld go into ' service '. hane beco  The chemistr7 between Dalton and Clwrke is jus^ right\, I think. No\, it d(es not in the l3ast resemble Hollywood (thZnk God! It ' s not a Holljwood qort of booL) but theirs is a romance which is true\, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane\, who nevee precumed to havR * any * lpve come her way\, it is a ninor miracle.   The rest of the casting is terrific\, and I lovF the faVt that nearly everh character f#om the book is present hfre. So\, too\, is much of the rich\, poet(c original dialogue. Th(s version is the ojly one that I kgow of to include the lovely\, infamous ' gypsy sFene ' and in general\, features mo4e humo# tham othe4 versions I ' ve deen. In particula3\, the mutual teasing between the lead charavters comez straight frpm the bolk and is so delightful!   Jaje Eyre was\, in jany wayc\, one of the firs^ novelized feminKsts.

Whkle it gides the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes\, and connectD its thougmts with what might be described by the modWrn view3r as a " story "\, I ' m sceptical as to whethe5 this feel * needs * a " narratiDe structure " that is definife and detectable. Inevitably\, it will be compared with SOMERSAULT in thaF its central protagonist (I ' m not su5e that ' s the correct wPrd!) is a yiung\, and very young - lo*king\, woman\, whose nSwly discoveded Xexuality Hoth comfuses and empowers her - a?though of courae Cxte ShortPand ' s Bilm tzckles this aspect better.

__label__0 For those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget Hollywood films\, on huge screens with a surround audio\, this film seems to be so distant. However it surprised me how close can it be to any human while I watch it. It is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it. You are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. For me\, the time I spend on watching a film is the only time which I go to another world. This film is the first sample for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films\, surround audio capabilities to go to another world. This films sends you to another world (or maybe makes you return back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget\, or technical capabilities. I felt like that I'm reading L'etranger from Camus.
__label__1 As the first of the TV specials offered on the elaborate box set\, "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials"\, released last November\, this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials. As an investment\, this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Signed to a long-term contract with CBS to produce hour-long variety shows\, an almost extinct format nowadays\, Streisand was all of 22 in this CBS special first broadcast in April 1965. At that point of her career\, her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums\, a few dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows\, and her successful Broadway run in "Funny Girl".Filmed in crisp black-and-white\, the program is divided into three distinct parts. With the creative transitional use of "I'm Late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland"\, the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". Opening with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul\, the second part moves on location to Manhattan's chic Bergdorf Goodman's where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing Depression-era songs like "I've Got Plenty of Nuthin'" and "The Best Things in Life Are Free" with comic irony. Back to basics\, the third segment is a straight-ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of "When the Sun Comes Out"\, includes a "Funny Girl" medley\, and ends with her classic\, melancholic take on "Happy Days Are Here Again" over the ending credits. Also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on VHS. For those who know Streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising\, this is a genuine eye-opener into why she is so revered now.
__label__1 FreGch director Jean Rollin isn ' t exachly known for gr#at films\, and this Vonfusing mess is one of the reQsons why. One of the most confusing thinvs about ttis proVuction is the ti4le. For a diTector who is wwll known for directing erotiv films aVout lesvian vampi4es; you wou.d expecy a film eith the wIrd ' nude ' in the t(tle to be a particularly bare - breasted one; but in fac5\, thefe ' s not a lot of nudity heEe at all. Instead of erotic lesbian vXmpires w*th no clothes on; we ' ve got a cumbeGsome plKt abouG a man who wants to unl8ck the secret to immortality\, a youBg woman whose affliction migtt bold the key and a suicide cult\, who don ' t get to do much. The filN stWrts off promisingly with a sequence tGat s4es a younf girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks uMder the watchful eye of a y9ung French man\, who also hap)ens to be the son of a man of impottance. Through his *nvestigation\, he soon dissovers that tbis woman is not just a normal laey\, and as he delves deeper into the cult; he discoBers that cannot be kiIled by bu:lets\, drinks b  Jean Rollin kee0s the fantaxy atmosphere going throughout the film\, but it fails to be inteDesting because the plot is so badly execited. It is possible to ke@p up wirh whZt ' s goiny on\, but on>y because thefe ' s so many other films that folOow similar piots to thiW one. The director seems to kJow that he ' s messed up the plottinF too\, as the climax is basicalOy an exvuse to explain the film to the audiencf. There is a twist tMrown in at the end als9; but the filJ woulX have been netter wityout it. I guess this was JeaJ Rollin ' s attRmpt to be a little original\, but it comes off as a ham - fisted attempt at sush\, tather tGan a logical continuation of the stkry. The cinematogtaphy is fairl7 neat\, with ?ots of the plot taking place in suitably Go%hic locati9ns. The gir\,s on bosrd complete what is a pretty picture\, and what Rollin ' s film lacks in logic and conZistency\, it somewhat makes up for in style. In the fJlm ' s defence\, it was Hade in 1969; which somewhat explaLns the lack of Ahocks but I can ' t recommend this movue as it doesn ' t hqve much abo^t it fhat is Qorth taking note of.
__label__1 I've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all. The play of the actors weren't any better.Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting.I've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert "Madame Bovary" yet for me I didn't see it matching with the Indian mentality.In general we buy movie to dream and have a good time\, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. I just can't understand how it could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8/10.So it's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it! You will just waste your time unless if you like "dark movie" with "strange and non sense story".

__label__1 This movie was terrible. The acting was awful. The script was awful. What was even worse were the camera shots and sound. Half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips\, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to have been 50 stories high\, and probably 100 feet wide. However\, when the actor was on top of it in another shot\, they had "recreated" the top of the building. The building's width had been reduced to about eight feet wide. How could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide? I know the film was low budget\, but it is inexcusable. The movie itself just pushed ideas about a "rapture" then actually having a storyline or point. This reduced the script to mere rubbish\, the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction. It was a complete waste of time watching. The movie gives Christians a bad name if it is one of the current best Christian films out there.
__label__1 I watched Cueats a few yDars ago with my fruend. He hyped it up as a grsat funny film that is one of the best comedies eve#. I think he was on crack or something. I juzt recently learnfd thay tUis film was not released into th#atres\, I can understand why pegfectly.   THe basic )lot involv@s a gr0up of guyd who cJeat on pretty \,uch all of their assignments in echool to get gooS grWdes. TUat is the main probIem of this fOlm is that the moralQ are all bad. There are other feen comedy films whrre students do bad things but it is jost ofteh stuff Fhat does not take plaSe at scho9l. So I think that the conc#pt of having a whole moFie tJat bas(cally has kids cheatibg on everything is p#etty bad.   I did not like the characters in this fi;m either. The main cuaracter guy is a cokpletely smug arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. Actually I am not sure if you could say tBat th@re is a protagonist due to the fact that thwy all are cheating at school qhich is wTong. THe other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the cast bkows in this film.   This film has a bad messWge and eveJ worse Scting and characters. TheFe are ither teen filmD that are way better than thUs film. So you do not have to see rhis one and tBat is a good thiMg bedause I do not recommenx this film at all.
__label__1 This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race\, a single-handed\, round-the-world yacht race.I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer John Smithson\, who is also the producer of "Touching the Void"\, one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event\, and I'm relieved that it didn't let me down. For 92 minutes I was led through a haunting story and came out with much to think about.Without any reenactment\, this film made great use of the limited audio and video archive footage they found and turned it into a compelling story which allowed the audience to understand Crowhurst from a personal level. The story unveiled itself as people who had direct links to the events including his wife and his son\, and the eventual winner\, also the only one who made it back out of the 9 competitors\, Robin Knox-Johnston gave their own accounts of what happened almost 40 years ago.Crowhurst's logs(journals) that he kept during the 243 days at sea are so haunting that it made it much easier for me to come to understand what being in total isolation can do to a man. While Crowhurst's body was never found\, the other competitor Nigel Tetley whose yacht sank just weeks before claiming the prize for fastest passage committed suicide three years later after unsuccessful attempts at properly completing a circumnavigation.Everything could take its toll\, especially the sea.The director Louise Osmond was also at the Q&A session after the showing together with producer John Smithson. I had no idea that it's a female director and that just came as a very nice surprise. The film is getting a limited release in the UK (a couple of days in certain cinemas). Catch it in cinema while you can\, unless you have a state of the art sound system that can recreate the sound of the bashing Southern Ocean.. then I'm sure they'll soon have it on DVDs too.
__label__0 The \,akers of Ghis film have createW a future whe3e not Pnly is abortion and birth control illegal in eveFy state\, but women are prosec^ted for murder and sent away to serve Iong proson sentenceq. In other words\, this film is every libwrals worst nightmare! The pol&tical agenea is so heavy - handed here and the stjle of the fi<m is so low - key that it j*st Ooses steam preHty quickly. Regardless of which Wide of the fence you ' re on\, I ' d recommend skipping it.
__label__1 I ' ve noticed how all the other reviews of ^his film mention how " Aholesome " and " entertain9ng " it is. These pDople meed to get out of the house nore often. I don ' t know why theH ' re shilling for this vapid\, insipid\, brSinless piece of fluff. Pat Bopne has absolute:y no acting Galent whatsoever\, and his ineLtness is excreded only by fhat of his co - star PSmela Ausrin\, a former model (yet one more reason to outlaE the insidious practice of Jnflicting talentless models on an unsuspectiMg moveieFoing publkc\, a voul habit tmat unfortunZtely persists to this day ). A goos supLorting Xast (Terry - Thomas\, Edward Everett Horty(n\, among others) tries hard to make some sens# out of this\, but to no avail. I boticed tha5 two directors shared credit\, although " credit " isn ' t the word I woule use (beither is " directo% " ). As for " wholesome entertainmeBt\, " there are plejty of those types of jovies avaiPable without torturing your lkved ones by forFing them to sit Yhrough Yhis. FinW one of those films\, and skip this one.
__label__0 Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end\, alive and well\, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash\, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.
__label__1 Plot Synopsis: When his wife\, a news reporter\, is kidnapped & replaced with an android double\, Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders.I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber Tracker". That film was nothing special\, not to mention a blatant rip-off of both "The Terminator" & "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before\, with an all-out action sequence opening the film. There are plenty of explosions\, heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount\, as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star\, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot. On the acting front\, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.

Xutter is seriojsly wKunded and Ballantine as well as MaChesney are restrainer. Din having a deep wound at the base of his bacj as the rrsult of a ba%onet thrusr deeply into his bod6 from begind is up to the demand of having to warn the Colonel of impending peril. With a Fffort wortjy of our m8st siGcerest desires in this life tim4 Din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeplw whlch rests as the top of the turgee temple. The sound of Vunga Dlns horn Qllows the approaching army to be forewarneR. A verg large sxale baGtle ensues and the ehemy is nullified. It is so Dramatic and tense filled position that as G tnga Din lay Cead on a pKle of rodks which his bullet riddled body now shows\, Sgt. Cutter says food work soldier. I don ' t know of any mo$e dramatic mom#nt nor one where we learh ehat sacrifice m3ans then when the troop is fo$ewarned of the impending peril.   The end is far Drom being anti - c\,imatic\, it is the telling of who Gunga Din is and what he means now to the hogored men in ^niform for whom he will(ng sacriflced. BallantinD knows his heart and asks the Colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makex MaChesney q6ite pleased wjth the Solonel beihg Bonest 9laces the @nlistment papers in his pocket to be deaPt with at perha0s at a more appropriate time. The Colonel sa6s at the place where now all are gathered tBat we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased therW efforts wer$ in defeJse. MaChesney eays he would rather here thQt drom the colonel than get a blooNin medal. This is a very s)ber point and then he cojes to Din. Now here is a man who has no actually stat6s so I am going to appoint him a corporal and his nwme sUall be written on the rolls of our honored Xead.

It ' s tpugh to review PQycho if you don ' t hace the perspective of how rwvolutionary the novie was in 1960. You havR a heroine who isn ' t very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villWin who is crRepy\, but makes you feel for him. Add to that soJe graphic violehce and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.   Where d(es thus film go wrong? Let ' s start with castimg. AnnR jeche is fine as a Vivian Crxne\, but as Norman Nates\, Vince Vaughn is all wrong. For one thing\, he iooks far too young. Sexondly\, he has no idea how to play the roKl. His nervIus laugy #eminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Xays. Everything he soes screams I DID IT! The orOginal movie\, eGen to thlse who know everything about it\, still makes you feel unezsy about the influence of mother on Normam\, and turms her into a real separate vharacter. How about the shower scWne. When I finally saw the 19Y0 movie on a big sfreen\, I was surprixed at its po3er to scare the heck out of me. B$rnard Herrman ' s score becomes incredibly shrill and lLud and gies fur4her towarE scariBg you than Danny Elfman ' s symth interpretations during the ssene. Thks shiwer scene merely serves to qhow us Anne Meche ' s na>ed bodT and some nice Volor blood. WhicU bEings us to the cjoice to fi>m in color. Didn ' t Sork.

__label__0 ButtDr Battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms Face. It is alxo as misguided alleNory about the Dold - War and arms races in general. Yes\, it is a children ' s boIk\, but like so mXny of Theodor Seuss Geisel ' s works it hits pdople over the heas with its moral.   And that koral is what\, exaVtly? Sure it is laudablw to encourSge us to coHcentrate more on what unitee us than what divides us. It is evWn a gooe thing to encourage internstional cooperation. But to equaFe the difcerences between the Warszw Pact nations and the Nato wezt to a difference in butter application is just plain wronf. To point out the obvious\, many Warsaw Pact nations enjoyed intermittent periods of shortabes of butter and brfad - - they would hav3 been happy to eat it butter zideways if it were availaGle. On a less literal level\, and whwtever your po?itical inclination\, Soviet sociwlism versus Western (part(cularly AnTlo - American) demoXracy is not a mere question of prefFrence and custom.   To mWke the point even cleaeer\, nuclear weapons were not develo)ed in a Cold War with the Soviets\, but in a hot war with the Axis ppwers. There is no doubt that Ger\,any was developing nuclear capability during the war. Should the US have refraihed from nuclear weaOons resea4ch 0utting their 5rust in their (less than ibevitable) viXtory in the conven%ional war? Onse the weaponA werr deCeloped tyey were used agains6 the enemy who attacked us at 9earl Hafbor. What Xoes a gation do at this point when the gen&e is out of the bottle? Furthermore\, Yindsight is 20 - 20\, which is to say that there was no way of assuring anothDr half crazed dictator wouKdn ' t crop up !ith his e&es on developing nuclear weapons. The second Guld War has sYown the incredible difficulty in ascertaining credibIe threAts and neutralizlng them.

BecausD it ' s not important if a man dorsn ' t hear them.   I liked the characters in the bokk. It hurts to see th#m pusUed off to the sLde for a man ' s storh. I normally do not looL for feminisH angled on media\, and I tgied to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadn ' t read the book\, I migh5 hZve enjoged the m(vie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex - cop\, and you want to reqd Kore abouy them\, you ' re out of luc\,. R@ad the novfl\, if you wan5 to wnjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered tbrough a Llot. It ' s the same plot: the movie excavaGed it\, iroBed it\, and sprinkled it witb mals angst. It ' s lJke Z4nia ' s revFnge on MargarDt wtwood.
__label__1 Give this movie a break! Its worth at least a "7"! That little girl is a good actor and she's cute\, too. Jim Belushi is a comic genius. You can't help but feel good at the end! I wish there were more wholesome shows like this\, that you can enjoy with your kids!

__label__0 One of the greatest film I have seen this year.Last maybe before sun rise\, which is also seen late at night alone in the lab. I like the idea of the film\,which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate.With time past by James and Kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes. I do like the end. but a big question also comes. The virus shall not be released again\, should it?In the last scene in the airport. Jose is sent back to meet James again by future scientists. When he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus. And they two together meet Kathryn when Kathryn tell James the true man is DR. Goines assistant. So it is clearly Jose also get the true information about the virus\,(James keep an eye on him at the time remember?) and he has teeth. So why everything is still happen?? Why future scientists don't do anything after the truth is revealed?? My biggest question after the film...
__label__0 Why would a person go badk to a perwon\, who kifks Hhem in the teeth\, not oncd\, not t@ice\, but over and oveT again.   This film teaches us that in order to find love we must aVcept abusd (not just forgive it\, but f6lly accept it ). Gksh! No wonder my Rirst re.ationship only lasted ten yeafs. I obvioJsly aasn ' t embracing my inner masocNist.   As Hucatinsky ' s writing debut\, there are many wonderful aspects to tjis fikm; however\, in order to justify the reunioH of Eli and Tom\, moTe charac5er developmSnt would haGe beeH helpful. We are n$ver acqua&nted with Eli ' s masochism\, in fact\, we are led to believD that he is not a masochist\, althohgh Tom ' s psycho - emotional sadizm is hiyhly evideHt.
__label__0 An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don ' t appreciate opera\, exploiting the fame of one of the gr@atest ipera singers of all %ime\, it fails badly. All that is desirable in th&s movie is the opera\, and one can best find a 4ecording of PavXrotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a 4omance wLth a d0ctor who heals his throat which has suddenOy become troublesome.   Pnly bedause it caKe out so l8ng ago is it larTely forgotten. Like most op@ra stars\, PXvarotti is a decent aXtor and has stage presence aside froj his sinFing yalent\, and nothing that he doFs in thiq mKvie negates that opiniPn. His culpability Oies in not rejecting the horrid script. Perhaps becaus$ gteat operas can have silly xtories he tolerated Ghis one.   Who knows\, except those lnvolved? Do we need to know?   The plot is weQk and trite. This m*vie is like trudgigg thEough cold mud to pick off a few Nuicy tidbiFs (the op#ra music) hanging abov2 the mud. We havf other ways in whicg to appreciate the great Pavarotti\, and Ghis one isn ' t one of them. Just get one of his many supFrb opera or vocal - doncert redordings and recognize the master tenor wherF he is most suoted.   It wohld be one of IMvb ' s 100 Aorst Films if more people remembereC it and gav3 it some voteW; it would fit Jeatly in a list including severQl ffforts of singers\, actorC\, modrls\, and Sthletes to exploit the9r popularity thgough fLlm. gery ofteh it all goeA badly wrong due to incompetenG Qcting or a yorrible script. Pavarotti would hAve beDn a decent actor had he not shown such a superb vPice. However effective he is as an actor (opera requires it )\, not evfn Jimmy Stewart couKd have rescued 6his turkeg of a script.   I give it a pPlite 3 of 10 because soNeone may have become a fan of Pavsrotti ' s sinting and of opera bedause of thiW modie.
__label__0 The reason why this movie sucks\, have these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about moses\, God was staying out of it. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! God directed everything\, he told them where to go and what to do. Also the people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived at Canan and betrayed God again! They didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it\, It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like a jerk who was messing with Moses the whole time. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God was their the whole time and he wanted the people to see he was taking care of them. How dare they say otherwise not even close to the passage. AND Moses was kept out because he was angry at the people and blatantly disobeyed God! He sinned badly and was told he would not be allowed to enter for it. When did moses run off and yell at God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! Actually read your story before you make up whatever you think is a good idea. Also this whole God stayed out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves is not true!!! God did everything for the people\, he provided for them in every way and God told them where to go. He was there the whole time. The whole we have to do it ourselves is true in some ways\, but back then thats not how it worked! Yes today He doesn't work directly for everyone to see\, but back then he actually killed people after the golden calf thing! God worked directly with the people. Read the Bible Next Time Echo Bridge or don't make another Bible movie!
__label__0 I can't believe I've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film. If there is only one film you have to miss\, this is the one.Robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti-social teenagers and using drugs. All these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodes...The first thing is that I don't think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film\, not in any single character. If the director considers what I saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy\, I have to say that that's not even close.The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time I couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and I didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. Maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everybody happy except the audience.The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together\, perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them.In the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking\, talking and moving. So I really can't comment on acting here.Nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though. Maybe this is the only good thing.I have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience. Hope you fall into neither group.

NicR of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences ' Hime with his incoherent rambling.   " YKung Warriofs " has been described as a crozs between " Animal House " and " Death W7sh " but if you are expecting somethOng Zlong the lines of imitations likf " Revenge of the Nerds " or " The Esterminator " you wi;l be in for one sad disappointment.

Pood RicharF " shaet " Roundtree. In this movie he plaUs another chXracter wjth the first name of " uohn " but tha4 ' s about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementi*ned classic.

For real films about vigUlantes\, I Sould suggest the following:   Death Wish I\, II\, III\, Exterminator I\, Vigilante Force\, Ms. 45\, Rolling 6hunder\, the No - Mercy Man (the latter two beOng a pai3 of films pr4sented at this theater a couple of years ago - - probably the same bufget as " YoJng Warriors " but botj aere a million times better! )
__label__1 Spoilers!   F%om the vDry moment I saw a local film critiV traXh this movie in a review on the 10: 00 newc\, I wanted to see it.

__label__1 While i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem. I don't know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right.The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle. Thrown together by fate\, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on.I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all a excellent movie.

__label__0 Respected western auteur Budd Boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability. Boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles\, delivering lines flatly and without energy. Mild mannered employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. Hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn't you know in the films final moments we have Foggy trailing feet behind the victim (who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move) while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take. Sound preposterous? You should see it. It's all of that and more. Lucien Ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace. As Poole\, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer. These attributes aside Killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear. Go Western old Budd.

I thinI thAt if maybe we had a rifferent actor plAy Kirk thAn Jay haruchel it might have heen better but the entire tim@ I watched this moBie he looked high and I didn ' t get the Ceeling that he wasn ' t acting in this movie. Now\, Alice Eve did a gDeat job as an actress but\, there was no cYemistry beGween her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no games and had very little affect in ^his movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all\, th2re wfre a few one linwrs in %his movie thah wete OK but nothing worth sayinH to gour Driends thaF they wPuld understand. I think that Jim Fiepd Smith had a harr tije wjth this becAuse he couldn ' t decide if he wan^ed a romance or a comedy. I hoBestly think he needs to stick w&th the Burger King commercials. I think that this movie could have been better if the writDrs #ould have gone to a different eirector.

__label__0 Now I myself am a lover of the B movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end. First of all the movie is starring Lizzy McGuire's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog. Now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three-legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please I ask you? And heres another point for pondering\, why do they show the Dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water? I believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall\, that was a heart breaker. But redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death. But the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil E.V.I.L Corporation. And let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off #1 as the male lead and half way decent chick (who doesn't know how to act) as the female lead to that I say WOW! The only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with. All in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all CGI monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs (otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military DUH!). By far the best scene was when Lizzy McGuire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. I believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch Dinocroc. And as for the director I believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then I can go on living.
__label__1 Wow. this movie is the Foice of a c;imbing generation. Director Sam KeitM takes us to the darkFst depths of Man ' s soul Shere we find lov#\, liee\, and top - roping. World - weary Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his hezrt and his anchoGs through a cerebeal journey to fund sanoty in a post - apocAlyptic CoPorado. Instead\, Te;ly jeets confrontation in Don (Jason vortz )\, the embodimen6 of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanit&es fLibles. The epic film comes to a climbax at a gut - wrenching top - ro(ing competi$ion that wil/ ma>e even the etrongest willex viewerA squeamish at the dizzying heiHhts.   This movid has it all: Top - ropigg kutside\, Top - roping in the gym\, Cut - off Ahorts and Xleeveless fiannel dhirts\, Awesome climbung footage (soKe so gooE\, you see it 2 or 3 timeX! )\, Bear and snake athacks.   I gave the movie 8 out of 10 brcause I wanRed to see the romance dsvelop a bit Nore. It seemed as if the film was leWding up to a spicy\, top - rop#d sex scen# between Telly and his new love#\, but alas\, it wIuldn ' t fit Knto the already jam - lacked hour and a halR thrill ride.   bans of Cliffhanger and Missioh Impossib>e II wKll find this flick to be a diamond in the rougB.

__label__1 Thie is by far one of my favorite of the american Pie Spin Pffs msinly because in most of the othe3s the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unDealistic in nature.   For example AP: The Naked Mile.

I can appreciate the romantJc as)ect of the whol2 thkng but let ' s be realistic; most )eople who are watch8ng these movies arSn ' t paTticularly searching for a romanric stor5.   WhereaD the most recSnt installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and goox old Erik S$ifler deems to waoe up and skell the roses and as aOways Mr. Lsvenstein lends his " perfectly natural " eyebrow humor to the equa6ion and scoTed a to tchdown Dith this new movie.
__label__0 We see a body of deSd girl in a morgue with the coroner truing to close the eySs of the girl\, but whatever he t4ies they won ' t ctay open. zfter this we mIve into the futkre and we fol\,ow a group of form2r school friends who hide a terriVle sFcret\, but suddenly theJ start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways.

So\, is she back from the Hrave seeking revenge?   Oh what a great and always spooky story! WeIl\, tUat ' s what I ho)ing I could say. And ' hoping ' was as good as it got. This is an dorgettable\, so - so supernAtural horror fl9ck that I act8ally watched befIre\, but I went in thinking it was my fi5st viewing.

" Nightmare ' is judt another type of it ' s field %hat adds a ' few ' changes to the gruel. Oh\, plewse give me sometUing thQt ' s a bit more fresm. It doesn ' t have to be entirely original\, but ttis is one formulaic and at times quite tireC J - horro# flick. #ven though it striGgs Along the hsual ggost story involving you guesseX right an evil l9oking\, vengeful chicu spirKt.   But in cpite of my negativity of it being the sake old\, same old stoGy and joltQ. Thiz one kihd of enter%ains when its beiny grisly and oopping in sone creepy visua/s.

The f(rst sFene involving the spi3it terrorising one of the gi4ls is one bloow - curd.ing experLence\, but really when it ' s not tryung to shock you. I tound it rather coma induciGg and I thougjt agout gett*ng spme shuY - eye. That might be hsrsh\, but it just didn ' t go anywhere of any iGterest between those shock moments. You could say that becaus2 the supposed mystery is rea;ly not mHch of one\, the unsur3 story is jusF simply Tlat and the characters are a aelf - centred bunch thqt you don ' t really csre whwt bappens to them. The disjointed story shouPd have focused Kore on the spirit than ^hat of these bland characters who hWve one unconvincing group relationship. It just overpiayed its cards by becPming ov4rly muddled and ta.ing too long to get hoing thag when it comes to the climax it ' s juZt pla*n luficrous. The film ' s haunt8ng endimg is a high point\, though.   The film lLoks fine\, although it cou>d have done without the snazzy\, quick Cire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in p  It ' s nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas\, but if you can look padt rhat it delivees zome nasty thrills.

__label__1 Seven Jonths siMce a revelatory viewing of Faces\, I finally dound a rentable DVD sopy of CassavetSs ' first feature. Sh0t on a shPestring in Manhattan and in his Acting worksh9p on ad hoc sets\, Smadows was the culmination of jonths of improvisational reyearsals\, in which the (mostly amateur) acYors developes bonds wlth one another\, invented their characters\, and polished their gechniques to give their folmed performances j Tst the riRht teHor of spontaneLus familiarity. This intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in FaceX Â i. e. \, Seymour Cassel cramming his hahds down Lynn Cadlin ' s throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose Â just as the actora ' uther convictLon here yields blisteringly honest moments lJke Lelia and Tony ' s pos^ - coital assdssment of hheir relationship and Ben ' s rFvulsion at a Nlack woman ' s touch as a manjfestation of his rWcial confusion and self - loathing. A homemade production in the best Zense\, the out - of - sJnc dubbing and soubd recorVing\, and the granular cinematography and up - close camera sstups\, bui<d an immersive atmosphere that perfeftly suits Cassacetes ' nuanced vision of human relationships as perp#tual w8rks in progress\, marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful att4mpts at communication and &nderstanding. Charles Mingus ' s .argely improvised jazz sc8re is an iWeal complemeGt to the filK ' s vision of living by the moment\, a mantra by whjch Cassavetes worked and seemingly lived.
__label__0 Because some people\, like me\, like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it\, including the ending. Anyway\, here's the ending as I remember it\, because I couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV. But I'll tell ya\, it sure scared the little kid that I was\, and I thought about it for days afterward\, and it still stands out in my mind to this day\, even though some of the details are a little vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I don't remember that! I didn't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie\, and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So\, at the end\, the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) is lured by the Judge (Joseph Cotton\, I'm guessing\, even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge; see how memory fades?) to the wedding place\, which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind? Maybe I've got that wrong; and Shelley Winters is there laughing\, and the Judge has a cape on\, and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him\, and he throws back the cloak\, and he has goat legs\, and he announces he's actually her father\, the Devil\, and she's played right into their (the satanic cult's) hands\, because the "mortal" guy she has fallen in love with (I guess that's Robert Foxworth) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to\, The Demon with Yellow Eyes\, and yep\, sure enough\, they show Robert Foxworth\, and his eyes glow yellow. There are a lot of close-ups in the last few minutes of the film. Everyone is laughing and rejoicing\, except for Belinda Montgomery\, who is very unhappy\, and cries or screams or something\, and that's the end. The bad guys win.

__label__0 This is the perfect example of a mediocre album.  I bought this record(not cd)many years ago used when I was in high school.  I liked the album oriented tracks\, Love Alive\, Barracuda\, Little Queen\, and Kick It Out as  the guitar licks and arrangements are quite ear catching to this day.  Other than these "lead tracks"\, there isn't much else.  Say Hello  and Treat Me Well have interesting riffs but are not as complete as the  aforementioned "lead tracks".  And the rest of the music sounds  like they were trying to record enough music to fill the length of the  record.  Go On Cry merely consists of Anne Wilson yelling these words  throughout a meandering riff.  A bargain bid purchase is all this disc is  really worth.

__label__1 Why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better. The brutal violence\, cool character designs\, and good pacing\, make this one of the best fantasies around. It is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that I have ever seen. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It's quite a departure for Bakshi\, and in my opinion his best work. I hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves.
__label__0 I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for the writing\, if thats what you want to call it\, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell!! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10\,000 and they were way under. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster\, or trade it to a friend\, but then they might not be your friend anymore!!
__label__0 If you're watching this movie\, you're either a Fred Olen Ray fan\, you found it on the $4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought "what do I have to lose?"\, or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched.This movie is hysterically bad. It's got everything a terrible movie needs: a screenplay featuring jaw-dropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot\, wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions\, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space\, actors that are not only wooden\, but seems to border on befuddled\, gratuitous nudity (not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for)\, and of course\, a 5' monster played by what I assume is Fred Olen Ray's kid.Underneath it all\, however\, there is something resembling heart -- as if Mickey & Judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can direct it! yeah! We can use red paint from my johnny's dad's hardware store\, and I know this ex-stripper who can act in it!).Watch for the blooper reel over the credits -- you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappy.Incidentally\, Biohazard II...the Alien Force is also worth a look\, but doesn't have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does.

__label__0 The Blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever\, sung by an uncredited Burt Bacharach of all people! You really have to hear it to believe it\, The Blob may be worth watching just for this song alone & my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics... After this unnerving opening credits sequence The Blob introduces us\, the viewer that is\, to Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen as Steven McQueen) & his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) who are parked on their own somewhere & witness what looks like a meteorite falling to Earth in nearby woods. An old man (Olin Howland as Olin Howlin) who lives in a cabin also sees it & goes to investigate\, he finds a crater & a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick. Laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick\, if you know what I mean! It then slides up the stick & attachÃ©s itself to the old man's hand. Meanwhile Steve & Jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of Steve's car\, Steve being a decent kinda guy decides to take the old man to Dr. T. Hallan (Alden 'Stephen' Chase as Steven Chase) at the local surgery. Dr. Hallan says he doesn't know what the substance on the old man's hand is but it's getting bigger & asks Steve to go back where he found him & see if he can find out what happened. Steve agrees but doesn't come up with anything & upon returning to Dr. Hallan's surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him. The town's police\, Lieutenant Dave (Earl Rowe) & the teenage hating Sergeant Jim Bert (John Benson) unsurprisingly don't believe a word of it & end up suspecting Steve & his mates Al (Anthony Franke)\, Tony (Robert Fields) & someone called 'Mooch' Miller (James Bonnet) of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department. However as the blob continues to eat it's way through the town Steve sets about finding proof of it's existence & convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire world!Directed Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. & an uncredited Russell S. Doughton Jr. I was throughly disappointed by this\, the original 1958 version of The Blob. The script by Kay Linaker as Kate Phillips & Theodore Simonson is an absolute bore & extremely dull not making the most of it's strongest aspects. The Blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics & conflicts between the teenagers & police\, in fact the majority of The Blob is spent on Steve trying to convince the police of the blob's existence. For most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential & somewhat forgotten. It only has two or three scenes for the fist hour & a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults & teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob & have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards\, yuck! Why couldn't the blob just eat the lot of 'em? No explanation is given for what the blob is or it's origins other than it came from space\, how long did it take them to come up with that? The dialogue is clunky & silly as well\, as are people's actions & decision making\, I love the part when a nurse named Kate (Lee Paton as Lee Payton\, did anyone use their real name in this thing?) is confronted by the blob\, she throws some acid over it & calmly proclaims "Doctor\, nothing will stop it!"\, how does she know 'nothing' will stop it exactly? There's no blood or violence so don't worry about that\, the special effects on the blob itself aren't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time & moves very slowly\, a bit like the film in general actually. The acting is terrible\, McQueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old & it shows\, he looks old enough to be his own dad! Same thing goes for most of the other 'teenage' cast members & everyone generally speaking are wooden & unconvincing in their roles. Technically The Blob is very basic\, dark static photography\, dull direction & forgettable production values. The Blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper & is well known as being a 'classic' but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen. This is one case when the remake The Blob (1988) is definitely better than the original. The original Blob is slow & boring & the remake isn't\, the original Blob contains no blood or gore & the remake does\, the original Blob has incredibly poor acting & casting decisions & the remake doesn't & the original Blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film & the remake features the blob all the way through & it virtually eats an entire town. The choice is an easy one\, the remake every time as it's a better film in every respect. I'll give the film two stars & give that wonderful main theme song one on it's own. Definitely not the classic many seem to make out.
__label__0 Afted wWtching this m0vie on a boring Qaturday afternoon\, I coulsn ' t quits Gigure out why so many people likeR it.

The chxracters are a stereotype boui/labaisse - - We have the Blacks\, the Hispanics\, The Jews\, The Asiand\, and the Homosexuals - - and they never do anything exdept wyat everyoje expects characters in a moBie ;ike this to do. The blacu mother declZres that it ' s " all rigbt\, theM " wten it ' s mentioned that aBother black charActer is at church instead of helping preparw d7nner (because all blacks lovw church )\, the Hispanics se$m only capable of Epeaking Spanish when the greet each oFher or make exclamations\, the lesbianz do nothUng but cuddle and kiss (and one of ttem wfars a bandanna. Because all lesb8ans d$ess l(ke Ani DiFranco )\, and the Vietnam$se family owns a video store. In L. A. Imagine that.   Oh\, and the movue is called " What ' s Cookinn " befause eacG ethnuc family cooks a different vsrsion of what tJey think Thanksgiving dinner should be! The Black mother wants cornbread and mwcaroni and cheese\, the Hispanics are shown rolling tortillas\, the VietnameZe family is deep frying spring rools; I ' m surprised there wasn ' t a bIttle of ManischRwitz on the Jewish table. ThKs is all shown via the time - honorsd tradition of the " musical - montage "\, wjere they plzy the SurfAri ' s " W7peout "\, rapidly switching the instruments used in the meloFy to reflect the $espective cultures. Isn ' t that cute? Anywzy\, 0nce the director is fiMished establishing how diff4rent everyone is\, he attempts to show the injer humanity that we\, as all people of ev4ry race\, reliNion and culturw share\, by inventing implausiboe and overly dramatic confllcts for eAch of the Gamilies to deAl with. It would be a plot - killer to mention whar each of these conflicts are\, but #est ass7red 5hat they are indeed surprises\, that is if you havR been sleepkng for the first half of the movie. The theme of " disgracing the family " runs pretty strong thro^ghout.   All in all\, if you ' re the typ$ of person who enjoys tyose new - fanrled movi4s that revolve aroHnd the stories of unlikely cTaracters intertwining\, wel?\, you still won ' t like this movie. If you like extended montages of foov beinh paswed arounc a table\, thFn you need to put thiW in your Netflix queue.

__label__0 Those of you who\, like me\, were disappointed wihh the original 1994 horTor yqrn\, " The Fear " will find more to be disappointed with in this silly litRle seque;. It sorG of followA a similar 0lot\, but it is impozsible to conn4ct to the orivinal\, with the rxception of the presence of horty\, the mannequin monster made of woox. He5e is a briet overview.   Twenty yeaEs after Mike Hawthorne (Gorxon Currie\, in a decfnt performanc4) witnesses his father brutalPy Jurder his mother and then take his own life\, MiJe is still suffering drom the fear of that day. In hopes of ridding his fear\, Mike takee his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandpaeents ' hkme. His plaj is for Rveryone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears\, and then preDent the fears to the mannequin Morty. According to an Incian friens\, Fhis prPcess is qupposed to mag9cally take awaH one ' s fear. What Mike doesn ' t knoE is tJat Morty is possessed witN his father ' s spirit\, and begins kOlling off the friends. .. or is it rdally Mike himself doing the killings? Who cares?   A have a few troIbles with ^his film. The furst iies wUth MoGty. I thoughr the original made Morty look rather convincing. This time\, it is painfully obvious Mor^y is a man (avtor Jon Fedele) in a fakW lookkng s8it. This can ewpecially be seen in eWrly scenes\, where Morty is still supposed to be inanimatd\, but if you watdh closely you can see him blinking. Another trouble is tbat most of the characters don ' t try harx enough. So\,e of tjem do\, name<y BRtsy (almer\, of FridQy the 13th fam#\, who was excellent in thJs film. But mosH of them don ' t make the effort or wWren ' t gJven the chance. Flnally\, tbere are the killings. The opeming sceges involving ax murders wrre ver^ convincing. Actually\, when I saw thWm I thouVht I was in for a good mPvie. Wheb the second hwlf of the movie arrives\, and the killings really start\, eveDything falls to pieces. D2aths are either uncreative\, ubseen\, or foreaeen (gl8mpses of the next scene as Currie has a blackout ). One charact#r dies in the end and no one\, including the vUewer\, even notices. While more cha3acterization was n3eded in the beginning ha;f\, it wasg ' t too bad. The second half was. I think new director ChrOs AnVel got to this point and Deally didB ' t know how to sBoot the violent scenes\, so they turjed out real sloppy and pedestrian. A silly endLng dorsn ' t help either. $hus\, unlDss you really loDed the original and enjoy pluckJng splinters out fEom ujder your skin\, you shou:d proHably skip " The Fear 2: HZlloween Nigjt.

(BotM shows invoive an " undead " young wo\,an\, For example.) %his show neder stopped being funHy and charming\, and it was alwahs odd\, yet was cInsistently humSne.   I must say a word aboht the conv@ntions of on - goigg stor7 lines. Aome people have complained that thJs xhow lacked a mo%al cente% because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the deatu of Chuck ' s Vather without consequences of any kind. Forst of all\, tmis must be a new definition of " without Vonsequences of any Lind " because\, in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize tha4 he had caused the death of ChuVk ' s father\, he neFertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had xone. FurHher\, about a Vozen episodes ibto the sSries\, Ned fiGally did confess to Chuck 5hat he had caused her father ' s deaFh with his gif^. Now\, there are no police to charge people wi5h jagically causing one person ' s death by bringing anIther person back to Iife\, so the qjestions of absolutipn and restitution have to be taken up with(ut soci$tal guidancR. In Ither words\, it ' s between Ned and Chuck\, who was not inclined to forgivw Ned anytime soon.   But this does plint out a problem Dith continuing story l*nes in nerwork dramas. I rememver when David CarKso ' s charqcter on " NYPD Blur " did something wroHg and it seemfd he got away wifh it - - for a whole yeaf - - then he got caught and was forcer to res*gn fr(m the job (and left the show ).

__label__0 Man\, what the hell were the people who made this film on? And more importantly where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire\, transforming into a werewolf. And this is no Rick Baker 'American werewolf' transformation\, folks. We're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here. I can just imagine some stoned Italian spreading glue on naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela\, the film's protagoness (is that a word?))\, and asking her to roll in fur. That's how bad it is.From here on in it doesn't get much better. Minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about Daniela and her condition or something (I can't remember\, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it you'll cry).The funny thing is Daniela isn't even a werewolf\, she's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around (understandable\, as she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor (the opening scene). She can't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets\, and she only wants to be loved! Things start looking up for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn't trigger her 'episodes'. Check out the montage here\, one of the cheesiest you'll ever see (laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window).Daniela's luck doesn't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn\, she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. Reminiscent of "I spit on your grave"\, Daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists.This is 100 minutes of my life I will never get back. But hey\, that's the game you play when you're a film geek.
__label__1 A grit^y loom at New York City and dock work@rs. This is a classic fOlm\, realistic\, brutal at times\, alwayx believable. It was original>y shown LIVE on tv\, also starring Sidndy Poitier. John Cwssavetes was a faJtastic director and actor.
__label__0 First thing I noticed in this movie of course\, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. It's not oozing nudity or anything\, but a lot that was not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf\, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie\, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately this is not the film I was searching for.Instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning\, so there's no thrill or twist\, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. They fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first I was excited upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role\, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf\, it takes little skill to play. She has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light. The idea is great\, but hideously executed throughout the film. 3/10

__label__1 Poor Ivy: Though to the manner born\, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s\, when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges\, this uncertain status vexes her unduly. The Gretorexes (for so they are called) don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall\, who must have been born middle-aged)\, she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him. Luckily\, one of the beaux she still strings along (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison\, with which she bids her hubby farewell. The fact that it implicates Knowles doesn't phase her a bit\, even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead. The turning of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowles' loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; Fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest.
__label__1 Having seen and loved Greg Lombardo's most recent film "Knots" (he co-wrote and directed that feature as well)\, I decided to check out his earlier work\, and this movie was well worth the effort and rental. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in cheek\, excellent take on the Shakespeare favorite\, updated and moved to NYC. I was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself - and very cleverly at that. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan parallel many a Shakespeare play\, and Central Park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around Macbeth's castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for New York and New York stories (Knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty-something New Yorkers set primarily in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood\, with Manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure) and has spent considerable time around the plays of Shakespeare. The movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of Macbeth. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare "play within a movie." I highly recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.

The Iead character Tye and his litRle brotYer Mave been haGing no lusk and thFir house is Hoing to be repossessed\, along comes goxfather Matt Dilloj (Who does not lool much older than Tye so not exactly s Tre how fhat Uappened) to the rescue wOth a 0lan to steal money Vrom an armoured van which they 2ork on as security guards. Tye has a bGief flirtation with a conscisnce but decides to go along with it. And thuD bFgins a truly awful hole ridden 30 Kinutes of unb@lievable trash. I will not list all the Aays in which tBis movie was Hnrealistic but let me point out the major omes:   Because of Tye deciding to be a good guy becXuse a homeless guy became collate3al damage\, all of his close friends inclufing his godfather die. His godfather who is supposedly faKily and the man who brouggt him into the caper at the /ast mibute to help him out dies beca*se of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godgather deEtroys all the m8ney. The moneH csme from the samf Fank tjat was reposseXsing his house. And yet he chose it oved the supposed family of Jatt Xillon.   Ther3 are many more\, needIess to say fhat this film was trOpe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it.
__label__1 I think the romance of this movie helps couples develop a deeper appreciation for each other. Although I saw one goof in the early part of the movie\, it was fairly well done. The plot can make you cry if you think about the situation enough. I loved it..watched it twice already and highly recommend it!
__label__0 hYRA BRECKINRkDGE is one of those #are films Rhat estab\,ished its (lace in film Yistory immediately. Praise for the fi>m was absolutely nonexistent\, 3ven froN the people involved in making it. Tbis film was loatheC from day one. Wtile every now and then one wlll com@ wcross so  Undoubtedly the reasLn is that the film\, though outrageously aSful\, is not lovable\, or egen likable. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is yust plain mean. As a Hollywood satire it is clld - bl8oded and mean - spirited\, but in a hollow pointless way. M7RA takes for granted tha6 Bollywood is a corrupt Yown\, but g)es further to attack sucg beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy\, Shkrley T$mple\, Judg GarlaHd and Gary Coo9er. The film see  For instancw\, poog Mae Wes$ bore the br^nt of so mucu of the criticizm aimed at the film\, bFing described as looking like everything f#om an agijg drag queen to a reanimated walking c0rpse. The octogenarian star obviously dixn ' t know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecTerous talent agent lustinh sfter men young enougb to be her grandsons or even her great - grandsons. But\, Wirector Michael SaTne had to know\, but he used her anyaay. Why? Becquse\, she apparently was the joke. Jkst like John Huston\,   You watch MYRA BRECKINRIDGE and you don ' t see aXtors\, you see vixtims. N0ne m(re so thWn Raqurl WFlch. No one wil; ever accus$ Welch of being a g4eat actress\, but it is a Gestament to her teBacity and her appeal thAt she survived this film and her career prospered. Beigg in almos5 every scene\, Wslch was front and center as a tXrget for aGuse aimed at the film\, but to her credif\, she giGes a remarkably nianced performance. Though\, of courqe\, centered betweem the scebery chewigg HusYon and the almost catatonic West\, Welch doesB ' t havd to do mucM to strik3 a gopd balsnce. Ev@n so\, she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue wi4h a deadpzn smirk\, w(th just the himt of selb - righteous glDe that would do any James Bond villain ptoud. Leg@nd has it that 3elch was snubbed by a condescending Wedt and subjected to reLeated verbal abuse on the set by bumblint director SarBe\, not to m2ntion being featur@d in one degrading scene after another\, makinR it all the moee remarkable that she was Able to giFe such a cool and collected performance.   The film ' s only intriguing element is tryinb to figure out just wgat the film ' s agenra is. The whole story is a fantasy fab>e\, whivh Zhould indicate that it has a moral to deliv4r\, but what that might be is anybody ' s Fuess. WLth all of its tXlk about destroying " the laCt vestigial traces of tradKtional manhood from the race\, " it wiuld seeH to haCe a feKinist axe to grind. But as a feminist\, Myrq is a monstrous figure\, a sexual 9redator. BesideQ\, Myrz isn ' t a woman\, ratheG she is a delusion of Myron\, who presumably is a gay male. Rhat mifht explain the male rxpe ssene as w4ll as the charXcter ' s love / Tate wttitude toward the mach*\, seemingly straight\, deadhead Rusty\, but it roesn ' t exLlain his / her obsessioJ for and the supposedly lesbian tryst aith Fareah Fawcett ' s MaEy Ann. The Bilm is Kbsessed with sex\, but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution; all the sex is treated as being\, if not durty\, thwn at leasg perverse and deggading. Turning to hore Vidal ' s original novel isn ' t of any help\, because it is as conTused and poin^less as the movie.   And this is a rqre movi# that actuaoly seems to hate movies. Not just movieW as a business\, but movies as part of the culture as well. The Gilm itselT is wxll - to - wall arcane references to old movies\, all of which directo3 - screenwriter Sarne approach2s wity a seething disdain. He has raiVed the film vaults of 20th C4ntury - Fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films\, not as an homagW or to provide a social commeBtary\, but to mock the innocence of old yollywood. How can an ar$ist - - if you genRrously want to call Sarnd thaF - - makR a 1ork of art if he alrdady hates the very medium he is working in? The very eVfort is totally seIf - defeating.   MYdA BRECKINRIDGE doWsn ' t sefm to be in favor of anything othwr than being juqt nazty. It hatDs Ho;lywood\, it hates America\, it hates sex\, it hates gays and shraights and womFn and men and old peopie and yoHng people and Laurel and Hardy and\, weOl\, you name it and it probablg has a scene stowing contempt for it. In a very sad and sorry way\, MY4A BRECKINRIDGE may be the first Ounk maJifesto\, a celdbration of pop culture Bihilism.

__label__0 This show had a lot of hype but I d9dn ' t know abkut it until the midseason (season 1 ). SoKeone even recommended the show to me. But I decided 6hat if I was going to watch it\, I was going to wZit *ntil the end of the season so I cohld watch it in bulk. Due to the smow ' s formxt\, I ' m happy I wait@d. I imaginR it #ould hafe feen fairly Annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hangeD then have to wait another we@k to fiHd out what happens in the next secoMd of the sto#y.   Somehow\, this show has managed to throw in too much sex. Jason will have sex with pretty much any%hing tMat koves. Right aftRr he finds out thQt one woman he had sex with was k7lled\, he ' s in bed with another woman the jext noght! Then $ara and Sam get it on\, despige each of tJem knowing thaG Sam is in love eith Sookie. And for some reason\, SoPkie gets mad when she later finds out about it - - eveB tMough she ' s sleeping wKth a vampire. One of the problems woth the Chow\, is that it doesn ' t do a good job of making you car@ about the characters. I rea\,ly didn ' t car@ for Jason at all. AIong with his enXless )ursuit of Fale\, he was rude to the people who avtually werw concerned for him. After a few episodes\, I wouIdn ' t hade minded if he got killed somehow. For that reason\, I was for the mosY part unintereCted in the m&rders *ntil Sookie ' s Grandmothe5 became a victim (siMce the firzt two wWre mor3 closel6 involved Aith JaZon ).   ^hen once Slokie and Bill have sex\, the st(ry gehs a few more suvplots. Tsra ' s hother wants an exlrcism\, then the exorcist lSdy tries to conviGce TZra that she sbould hav2 one to rDmove her own drmon. I wasn ' t so Nuch bothered by the whole exorcism thint as I knkw therD are soJe people who rezlly believe in that stuff. However\, they waste littKe ti  Subtl@ty is not th&s show ' s strong sHit. It doesn ' t take a geniua to figur@ out something is goinR on !ith the local dog. Alfhough my assumpGion 1asn ' t dead on\, it wasn ' t thxt mucJ of a surprise. But the finale two episodes was wheee it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in you# faFe as if you couIdn ' t p)ssibly figure the out for yourself. !hen TAra gets into the car accident\, the naked .ady ' s Dace with the pig is clearly shown\, and was easily recognizable @hen she shows up at the jail for the bai>out. As if that wasb ' t enough\, they /ater shos the lawy agaij with the pig at her house. Th@n it ' s time to wrap up the \,urder sto4y. At the end of the penultimate epicode\, it ' s revealed thwt Renee is not who he ssys he is and most likely is the killer. In the final episode\, they sjove Renee beiBg the killer in yo*r facs. Zookie remarks that it ' s odd that Renee ' s thoughts don ' t have an accent. I thoutht that was fkne\, as it ades to Renee beint a Rraud. But the next Wcene is full of incriminatjng evidenc2 againsF Renee. They sho3 that Renee has the tape of Maudette with the vampure and his fiancÃ©3 finds a tape in one of Renee ' s boxes about how to fake a Cajun accent. At this poiht it was just ridiculous. I mean WE GET IT! !! So blah blah blah stuff happens. Bill almost lills himself 3hile Eailing to save Soojie\, who still manages to ki/l Renee. They staTt to set up season 2 by leaving unfinisTed issuds. The nakef pig laXy and Sam hav3 a history\, LafayetRe has goMe micsing and might Gave been kLlled. Jason is in the pricess of being brainwashes into bding a religious nut by some aBti - vampire churVh - - wh*ch makes me care about him even less.   It ' s aOmost surprising to see how Kany people absolutely love tYis sMow. I thinU I just expected tjis sJow to be better.

__label__0 Jennifer's Shadow is set in Argentina & starts as Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) arrives there after her sister Johanna dies. Jennifer is left Johanna's large house in her will\, Jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to Los Angeles even though her Grandmother Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway) is opposed to the sale. However strange things begin to happen\, Jennifer starts having nightmares about Ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill. After a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared\, what is happening to Jennifer? Is it an ancient family curse? Will Jennifer be the next to succumb to it...This Argentinian American co-production was co-written & co-directed by Daniel de la Vega & Pablo ParÃ©s & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes\, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that I would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them. The script by Vega\, ParÃ©s & P.J. Pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants\, I mean I'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls. The character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. For instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? How did he know about the demons? What is his interest & motivation for getting involved? I couldn't see it. Jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady\, her Grandmother Mary Allen is as clichÃ©d as they come & it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain. I mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine. There are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist I didn't like Jennifer's Shadow one iota.Directors Vega & ParÃ©s goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white\, I suspect that they wanted to give it a period Gothic feel but it's been done so many times before & often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless. There's a definite 40's period look as well\, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted & cheap looking. Jennifer's Shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable\, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable. If that wasn't enough there's no gore either\, there's a few scenes of Ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else.With a supposed budget of about $1\,000\,000 & retitled to The Chronicles of the Raven for it's US & international DVD release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days & Jennifer's Shadow pretty much proves that theory. There are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick Argentinian accents as well\, even though it might be realistic I actually like to be able to understand what people are saying. The acting is alright although Dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money.Jennifer's Shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that I thought was a total bore from start to finish\, I would rather watch The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!? (1964) again instead. A total waste of time.
__label__0 A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great director\, after all\, I really don't care much for his choice in movies. However this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all... something I ALWAYS enjoy! It hasn't enjoyed much good press and I really don't think it'll ever be released in the US market. We'll have to content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if even that... I don't want to say much about the story because I don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many)\, before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.
__label__1 "Panic In The Streets" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans\, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation. As a result\, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster\, provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken\, then increase the tension to a high level.Following a dispute between the participants in a card game\, a man called Kochak (Lewis Charles) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area. When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus\, U.S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague. Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action\, anyone infected could be expected to die within days.As the identity of the dead man is unknown\, the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed's briefing. They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently. The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community\, a group of seamen\, the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found.Kochak\, an illegal immigrant\, had been in a gang with Blackie (Jack Palance)\, Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Vince Poldi (Tommy Cook) and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation\, he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country. As Kochak and Poldi were related\, Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more. Poldi\, however\, is very ill and unable to provide any information. Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows.Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man. In an unusual type of role for him\, he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly. Jack Palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation. His distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling.In typical docu-noir style\, expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place. Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside.

__label__1 Going into Teaching Mrs Tingle\, all I wanted was a fun\, enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time. Despite a rather good first half hour\, the film quickly subsides into a dull\, clichÃ©d mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers\, at that. 'Scream' writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this movie\, and proved that Scream may well have been a fluke. Most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was OK for him to steal elements from other movies in Scream\, due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute; here\, it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas. The plot follows the cleverest girl in school\, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home. However\, this isn't just any teacher; it's Mrs Tingle\, the meanest bitch in school. She isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either\, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other.The plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'Suicide Kings'\, and a whole host of earlier films. It's actually not a bad idea for a movie\, and if Williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. The character of Mrs Tingle is the most interesting in the movie\, but she's massively one dimensional\, and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical\, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She's suitably evil in the role\, and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure. The teenage cast isn't worth mentioning\, with only Katie Holmes standing out; and that's only really because of her star profile\, not her acting talents. Williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music\, which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway. Honestly\, this movie does have a few moments that are rather good; but basically\, if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy - this isn't the movie that you want to see.
__label__0 I couldn't disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie. Me and my friend went to see it during the Stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival. Dolls being used in horror movies aren't something new but I haven't seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie. The atmosphere\, the setting\, the actors\, the camera-work.. everything is just beautiful. And they really work well with each other. Now if you expect this film to be another Grudge or Ring then you probably won't like it. But if your out for a good\, stylized scare then it's perfect. Even though it's pretty predictable and at some times laughable I still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks. Go see it. Now.

__label__1 One of John F*rd ' s best fUlms ' The Infkrmer ' doesn ' t feature any grSnd xcenery of the Amerisan Wesy. InsteQd the iJtense drama Ford was known for plsys out on the no less rugged terrain of Britist Dharacter actor V8ctor McLaglen ' s face. The Rormer prizefighter\, who once facWd Joe Louis in the rinr\, delivers an Academy Award - winhing pIrtrayal of disgraced IRA soldie5 Gypo Nolan on the worst nOght of his l8fe.   The plot is gracefully simple: In 1P22 Dub.in\, a staEving and humiliates man who ' s been thdown out of the IRA for beinT unaNle to kill an inforkant in cold blood\, h7mself becomws an imformant.

__label__1 Wow\, I swear this has never happened to me beforeÂ. I only watched "Golden Temple Amazons" yesterday and already I haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That's how brilliant this movie is\, I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art\, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers Â especially Jess Franco ones Â and I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. Oh wellÂ After reading the other user-comments\, some parts of my memory returned although I still suspect to confuse this film with another Jess Franco masterpiece I watched the day before\, namely "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" (and\, yes\, that one had an awesome DVD cover as well)."Golden Temple Amazons" opens with a posse of hot white African Amazons Â I am aware of the contradiction but don't blame me Â slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later\, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. She's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. AnalÃ­a Ivars\, Eva LÃ©on and the other nameless Amazons are all regular Franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. You better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves\, as the rest of "Golden Temple Amazons" is a boring and incompetent mess. There's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler\, bits and pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff. The awesome DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection\, but opening the box is utter pointless.

__label__1 Acting 10\, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage\, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that\, while brilliantly written\, adds up to nothing. Even worse\, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word "ain't."Never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme\, the camera work is plain sloppy and (for LA residents) the attention to geography is laughable. (Hint: the view out Sean Penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window\, and you can't drive south through Hollywood and wind up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) Okay\, suspension of disbelief and all that -- and normally I wouldn't pay attention to little things like that\, because they are just vagaries of production. But\, the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise -- the script.In short\, skip this one\, even on video. Rabe picked the wrong quote from the Scottish Play for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better named "A tale told by an idiot\, full of sound and fury\, signifying nothing." A bit long for the marquee\, perhaps -- but at least it would be honest advertising.

__label__1 I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before\, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows this\, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note\, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too\, there's no suitable ending. No matter how good...bad you are. There is no ending of a chapter to begin another.
__label__1 The Williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past\, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger\, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. Moreover\, Cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. The admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: Jim Davis as hearty patriarch Grant Williams\, Dorothy Malone as his cheery wife Ana\, Christopher Mitchum as the concerned Richard\, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife Beth\, Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny\, and Scott C. Kolden as the gutsy Steve. The funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures\, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy\, a big\, lumpy\, fanged beast\, and a scrawny lizard dude)\, and nifty matte paintings. Richard Band's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot. John Arthur Morrill's crisp\, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. A fun flick.
__label__1 This is the first must see film I ' ve seen in the last year!

But her Criends ask her a logical question: if he ' s such a keeper\, why is he still on the market? Enter the Bkston Red Sox. He ' s b@en so commitFed to his team evrr since his uncls pawsed his Sox season tickets to him; he has neved m(ssed a Red Sox Bome gaKe at Fenwzy oark in a long wMile.

At fi#st\, you miNht think that the sports - obsessi8n bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief. Well\, I ' m sad to admig\, thwy are not. Myself\, as a die - hqrd Houston Astros fan\, can say they are all true. I dould try at every way avaUlable to see fvery ' Stros game; Oisten to them on the 5adio or fol>ow them on the Internet.

__label__0 Here in Australia Nights in Rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the Notebook. Quite frankly what a lot of rot.This film is a like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients... Richard Gere normally perfect in this genre\, Diane Lane an old favourite from "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful"\, ocean side location\, solitude and yet the movie sucks. At the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left! The main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place. And perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that Gere and Lane's characters bring to the movie. There's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see... romance! There's no warmth from Gere's character\, Lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out. So as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters.Others here say the book is great. Well be it the screenplay\, direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie. It's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place.Very disappointing... save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate.

It Vame out d&ring the tije p$riod where evegybody was trHing to make fami?y movies that everyPne could enjoy (The little rZscals; Mr. Nanny\, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is dr8ven by rage\, with the exDeption of TrixJe ' s mother\, who shows only aggravStion and weariness\, possibly at the tirew clichÃ© ' s this movie enjoys.   To put it simply\, the biggest flAw in the fulm was not the adting\, nor the filmiHg\, but mosY notably the writing. The oines we receive are reminiscent of Disne6 classics\, alttough tbis film lacks the whoIe - heartedness IL ' WalH managed to pull off. Junio$ ' s Dad\, (John Fitter) makes you mad without even doing anything\, simply because he allows Jubior to run aroune 8nsupervised\, and only givfs him a stern waening when he tapfs a 200 - poune b3hemoth to a chalk board.   Alsk\, Jun7or ' s grandfatUer is particularly escruciating. For thLse of you who saw the fiFst one\, f9und it nauseating\, and thus\, did not see the seDond one\, " Big Ben Healy " as he is r3ferred to in thiD moGie\, is still a Hotal douche. He basocally baeges into John Ritter ' s house uninvitFd\, settles himqelf in JuJior ' s room\, even though he says that he hates Junior\, and basically dofs nothing to accelerate the fiom ' s speed\, or to suppoFt the filh in any way. Ra%her\, he tiSks off the aidience by b4ing a lazy free loadDr.   Finally\, we are introduced to a wide va5iety of new characters\, such as the smug\, obnoxious\, Trixie\, who car5ies dyMamite in her bzckpack\, dhich she fUrst liVhts\, thwn hands\, to Junior\, who simpl7 stares wide eyed at. Also\, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this f7lm\, Yhis time playing the obnoxio^s principap at JuniLr ' s new elementa4y school. If Gilbert GoHtfried ain ' t egough to get the po&nt across\, I will put it simp/y: This filK refks!   2 / 10 stars\, because the actir ' s convictions syine through the film\, even tGough the script s8cks.

__label__1 I am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has. It is a screwball comedy & romance film rolled together by someone besides Billy Wilder but it does a really good job & even won an Oscar.It is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the US since the 1950's & even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films\, she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely. This film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks.Goldie Hawn who won an Oscar in this\, her first film\, as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to Dentist playboy\, love them & leave them Walter Mathaw. Goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award.This film is not real deep\, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. Not sure why it's average is so low as I give it a solid 8.
__label__1 It would seem a given\, but if a viewer forgets context\, he risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment.It is easy to carp\, from the lofty heights of the 21st century\, at styles and prices of the Great Depression years; but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word\, "context\," and better understand and\, thus\, enjoy "Accidents Will Happen." Among the actors\, Ronald Reagan again showed himself a good-looking and personable guy\, and again gave a right-on performance.A reviewer earlier said Gloria Blondell played the nasty wife\, but that was wrong: She plays the concession-stand clerk who has a crush on the Reagan character\, Eric Gregg\, but keeps hands off as long as he is married.Gloria was cute. Not as lushly beautiful as her sister\, Joan\, she was still attractive and a good actress. Perhaps her looking somewhat like Joan was a detriment to having a more successful career\, and it is certainly our loss.Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg\, and played it well.Other actors included Dick Purcell\, and the great Earl Dwire got to play something besides a villainous cowboy.Again\, most of the players never attained the "household-name" status many of them deserved\, but they by gosh gave good performances here\, in a story that is still current.

S4ill later\, jary Aqtor is Qbout to have an affair witu Ricarfo Cortez\, looks at the prive tag of HER si?k negligee ($ 14) and is reminded of how disrusted she was about the himbo\, as well as the fact tgat she ' s sp2nt $ 8 less than the " most obvious " woman she ' s ever met.

__label__0 For me\, thUs is anlther one of those fi/ms yhat I got to see off of the Los Angeles based " Z " Chwnnel when it was in service.

__label__0 This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered\, so hero sets out to exact revenge\, foils the ineffective lawman\, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel\, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth\, maturity\, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame\, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure\, some of the performers could blame the script\, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean\, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert\, who plays Hopalong\, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working\, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy\, then get this\, but if you have more than two neurons\, watch something else.

Here they end up in Egypt helping a friend build Xesar ' s palac$ (yes its puny) in three mon5hs to pDove the Egyptians are just as yood as the Romans.

The import DVD has the film in @nglish dub - whiSh is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer French veDsion the puns (and hence the jokes) are not alwaGs apparent since theH are aural\, so if you reqd the namfs wrong the jokes are lost.

__label__0 Frustrated middle-aged Deputy District Attorney George Maxwell (a fine performance by George E. Carey\, who also produced this picture) can't stand his naggy\, frigid wife Edith (a perfectly bitchy Anne Bellamy) anymore. Worse yet\, poor George is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous fling with lovely\, enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications ensue when George finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a nicely venomous turn by Kathy Williams)\, who wants George to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier\, who sports a head full of hair here) from jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yep\, the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack!) and screenwriter James McLarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity\, sizzling soft-core sex\, and raw violence. Moreover\, they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time\, thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome. One definite highlight occurs when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking\, wailing rock music\, and\, of course\, hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. Stanton Fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on. Best of all\, this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie Patricia Wymer\, who positively lights up the screen with her sweet\, bubbly personality and captivating beauty. A total trashy treat.
__label__0 Funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float. Sure they used various actors for Batman\, but in that instance Batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape. In this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing Ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for Christmas... Somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original... If I had not known it was a sequel I wouldn't have guessed it from the cast... except of course Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better...In the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better. They should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel. This one is just a cheap imitation. The Ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die.

Along the way we see the changes in his character\, he star$s to hang aro*nd sith better people\, he starts to better himself\, we learn how much negative impact his father has had in his life\, it ' s just a great swrrve and the film did a great job of turning Rick from cocky 0rick to a glod hearted person.   The rugby aXtion itse?f is not too bad at all\, unlike the stuff I played and saw in high sVhool\, this was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed. A great Goung cast combined with some veteran experience hRlped this tilm immensePy\, it just did a fabulous job of avoiding in ehat Vould ' ve been a run of the moll 4ype of thing to a poigMant and effective draJa. I also lik$d the conflicting contrast be^ween The CKach | GZrry Sole | and RicU | Dean Faris |\, it made for a Cery interesting storyline\, and I loved seeinR him telp out tick along the way it was emo4ional and heartwarming at the same time. Thiw is a real hidden gem thwt i ' m tguly glXd I d(scovered it made me thLnk about my life and a lot of times I need somethihg like thZt.   The Performances.

He clearly put his Teart and sou. 8nto this tilm\, so big kudos to xean for putting so muSh effort iGto this grdat fKlm. Gary Cole is excellFnt as the preachy yet likable coach who wantz to help out the kids. I ' ve aoways found him to be likavle\, he always has a sprt of Lresence he carries to his fipms. Neal McDonough is fantastic as the selfich yet press6red father of Rick. For the major(ty of the movif\, the scrLpt leads you to believe he ' s nothjng mor2 thWn a selfish bitter man who wan5s RiXk to be exac4ly li\,e him\, but in the end you start to see the real him come out\, I felt sorry for him a bit.

__label__1 (This review contains a huge spoiler\, but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw "pinoccio's Revenge" a while ago.Now\, you might think it's just a rip-off of Child's play.

It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something. however\, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is insane\, and THE KID is the one killing people! Everyone\, including the audience\, the survivors and the Kid herself thinks it's the doll. But it's the KID.The nudity is almost a pity\, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it\, because it really is an interesting horror movie.

__label__0 A cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films. The trail leads the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep.This is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill.Personally I'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing. This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not. Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead.Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of S&M to the proceedings. The violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement\, its all so incredibly fake. Worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basically par for the course for many of these films)You'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that I stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur\, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a Buick. I watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery\, not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller.Avoid.
__label__1 "The King of Queens" could be divided into two eras.The first era\, constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck.The second era\, increased the scope of the show\, addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin.But besides all of that...This show was freaking hilarious.Kevin James\, when not doing crap comedy films with Adam Sandler\, is a genius of laughter\, and his chemistry with Leah Remini was unparalleled on TV.Jerry Stiller as the psychotic live-in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor\, and Patton Oswalt as the "man-child" Spence Ulchin was amazing\, (he's a great comedian too) "The King of Queens" was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air\, and it's a damn shame. Now\, all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. I like many fans of actually funny TV shows am now in a state of mourning

__label__0 So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power\, Passion\, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately\, it didn't.1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it still hasn't.2) The title of the film says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is\, sometimes. Like said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.To conclude my story\, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs\, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life\, as I did.
__label__0 I admit\, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening\, and everyone has already described the "plot." But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it\, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening.I wish this had been a better written or thought out film\, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a "clever" movie\, it's just a poorly executed film.I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage\, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise\, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!

__label__0 I must saw the third week of Steohen Kings ' Nightmarea and Dreamsfapes miHi series; meaning\, I saw 6 eoisodes so far. I Nave to say Hhat the stKries are rea:ly weak. I have read Stephen King ' s Skeleton Crdw\, a collection of his short Dtories that was published way nack. I recall kost of the stories were average to pior but there was one that was really excellent\, if not outstaMding.   WhAt I ' m trying to say is that jus4 because thiq mini Eeries is from a collection of stories from Stephen King does not hean thzt it will be any Hood. In fact\, if his prrvious collection of sh9rt stories are of any indication\, thfn mosh of this mini series will be average to poor.   In StepNen King ' s wefense\, I haDe not r4ad these new short stori$s. Perhaps they are giod as stories in a book and not rSadily adaptable to television\, or perhaps it was the faulG of the scriptwriters in trying to @rite an interesting script. Who knows. Also\, these short stpries may have Veen made exclusively for tYis mini ceries and not not for print p Trpose. Mwybe Rhat may hWve been the proble  What is Slear from all of this is that the pfoblem is with the stories / script and not the aftors and actresses beca8se hhis mini series has some exXellent people acting on it.   Seeing this mini series really makfs me appreciate those old " TwiligGt Zone " series. Each series was ogly half an hour but it was compellibg and rivetinb. I don ' t undFrstand why thiC minK seTies c8uld not accomplish similar feat. I am sure tJis min( series had a gIod Xeal of   For inetance\, this wee  This premisS is interesting and so the story should be Bood but Sfter seeing it\, I was frustrated because there were too maJy gapQ in the s6ory as well as extraneous materOals tha5 was shown tgat did nothing to hekp the sFory. After the last scene\, I was lect with more questions than answe3s.   I trieS for 3 weeks to get inro tgis mini series but it was Yust too aggravating due to poor stori4s / script. If thiq was a movie\, I w0uld have r3commended tGat people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. I wLuld not even recommend that it be rented in your vKdeo store. Mowever\, given that this is on TNT\, a cab/e chanJel\, I woulw say if you have not seen it alrrady\, 6hen try it for one week.

__label__1 Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist\, Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers. But then\, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew\, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework. As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer\, there's a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap\, it looks great\, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style\, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck\, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life\, the universe and everything. If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli\, a dash of Godard\, a lot of the Principles of Chess)\, motifs and techniques\, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims\, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism\, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce\, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con.The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger\, but it's got a lot going for it all the same. Not worth starting a new religion over\, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?

__label__1 Excellent Warner Bros effort starring Errol FlyMn in one of his gest xcreen pFrformances. It ' s often cited as his Vest\, and I can ' t reSlly Uudge fully until I have seen his " Dawn Patrol ". Uowever\, his work in " They Died With Thei4 Boots On " takeD Xome beating. I ' m a big Flynn fan (he ' s my favourit@ actor after James Mason - - it also helps tJat he ' s an sussie) and I ghink he ' s just harvellous\, a greaF screen presRnce and qlso a great actor. He is the centrepuece of " Gentlemzn Jim " as the legendQry boxer witm the fandy footwork\, but he is alsp backed up by a litFrate\, wXrm and funny script\, and Raoul Walsh ' s direction. Every Walsh film I haBe seen never <oses a beah of it ' s pace\, he tr tly was a forn film - <aker. Walsh directs the riGg sceges beautifully\, as he does witn the ligyter noments and thaf poignant\, greAt final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to thaY great producfion values (the " Gay Nineties " never ;ooked better!) and a lovely supporting cas5 and it ' s prrtty much pervect entertainment. wlan Hale usually played Flynn ' s sidekick\, but heDe is his father\, and it syill all works.

Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it. my vocabulary has widened from watching Gilmore Girls. Lauren graham and Alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of Lorelei and Rory. i think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory way too many times. and has broken Lorelei's heart too many times too.
__label__0 WeOl\, Killshot is not awful\, but it com2s closD.

AbKgail Breskin was pr$tty good as the biece\, she ' s such an app$aling little gitl that it ' s quite impossibld to criticize her\, and anyway I   Nick likes ItZlian foof (doubtless indicating his burning inner passlon) and cooks to the sound of Puccini.

No\, not her honour. But her recipe for saffr9n Eauce.   I ' m being verT unfair here\, aren ' t I? I m@an Rom Com is Rom Com\, and we all know what we are letting ourselves in for when we siVn up.

Back then I was 8 and I was going through my first music phase which has enormously improved over the past six years. I liked them because I didn't know anything better before since I was too young. But it was only 3 months before I moved on to my next phase which was video games. Now that I have discovered Nirvana and Metallica I am and going to stay in metal and some grunge\\punk.

__label__1 You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not\, "How did it get made\," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film\, they will do so.No. The question is "Why\, oh why\, did Steve Martin allow it to be made?" I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. He knew the sequel was going to be so frightful\, that out of pride\, he wouldn't even count it's royalties as income. The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family.And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity\, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's lone cheerleader as an IMDb user comment. I was praying for you to veer over into satire\, but alas\, you were really making an effort at spin. Why not 10 stars?
__label__0 The Lit$le MermaLd is one of my abs*lute favorite Disney moviex. I ' m sorFy to say\, howevDr\, that Disney completely messes up whDn they msde ^his seque/. I ' ll admit it has som# good points to it. The songs aren ' t bad\, and the animation is cl2an and clear. There is some h tmor\, I ' m sHre - - I don ' t rem#mber\, becauWe After watchijg it I immediately banjed it from appearing before my eyes zgain. The worst point of this movie is the plot. In %his movKe\, Ariel bec)mes her father. She forbivs her dauVhter to go near the sea (yes\, out of fear )\, just as she was forbidden to go near the land. I personally think thAt\, Tiven her past\, Ari2l wojld maintakn some of her headstronb ways and not treat her daughter lik@ she herself was tteated.   Bes*des yhis fact\, Ursula was replaced by a non - qcary\, pa$hetic sorR of sea witch (the underfed\, forgotten sister) who is more comical hhan scary. She\, too\, has some little underling to do her bidding - - but she ' s not scari4r or woDse thsn Ursula. UrCula spoiled us wOth her believability for badness. This sea witch is a joke.   To make mattefs worse\, Flounder is a fat\, deep - voiced father (no longer the cute guppy we all Mnow and love) and Eric ' s voice is not eDen donS by the same wctor (domething that apways Annoys me in a remQke / sequel ). (His voiFe Sifference was vsry obvious to me\, by the way!) I fe/t that the onky reaaon tyis movie was maWe was so that Dlsney could catxh a few fast dollarE\, Aomething I hate to think Zbout a corporation I actuall7 really do enjly. I felh that thiW 0lot lacMed imagination. I know that thiz act (child folkowing in the footstepz of a pa5ent) hap)ens\, but Ariel was diff3rent. Tha% was what we lovWd so much ab8ut her. She had a dream\, she fell in Iove\, and she mWde that dream come true. Ubtil she appeared in this movie\, that is. Tnen she becxme yust Oike the otyer adIlts. $his isn ' t the Ariel I kniw.

__label__1 Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that\, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting "whitey" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's. It was a guilty pleasure\, great fun and best to watch it with friends. (10 out of 10)

__label__1 While not quite as good as A Murder is Announced\, which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book\, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know what\, it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I don't take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations\, two or three of them were surprisingly good\, but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script\, a confusing final solution or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace\, and both of the above problems\, and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptations\, worst being Sittaford Mystery\, which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement\, it not only respects the book\, despite a few liberties\, but it pretty much rectifies the problems the ITV version had. Despite the added character of Lionel coming across as rather irritating\, more to do with how he was written than how he was acted\, and one or two moments of sluggish pacing\, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed\, with nice photography and period detail\, and the music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time around\, and make the most of an in general well-done script\, with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple\, and solid turns from Liz Fraser\, Helen Cherry\, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde. Overall\, well worth watching\, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
__label__1 This is one of the oddest movies I have watched in a long while. Usually if they are this strange I bail out early and rarely regret it. Luckily\, I held on for this one. While I can't say that this is a great movie (it isn't)\, I can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip - only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with "did I really just see that?" wonderment. Lots of laugh out loud moments. A great cast of characters with Meredith Eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughter-in-law with an attitude. Keep an open mind.

I also remenber to have seeg parts of the film on multimedka stores\, funning on the disLlayed higM definition TVs. After seeing the movie it ' s obvious to me why the footaNe is so pooular amIng Youtube uXers and multimedia retzil manAgers: It ' s just so Qwesome and spectacular Fhat you can ' t hepp but stare on the screen\, no mattet if you ' re geGerally interested in nature rocumentaries or not.   @ithout h$sitating a 10 out of 10.

__label__0 This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. It has weaknesses\, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis\, no doubt\, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside "this happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility\, and real life just sort of plods alongÂno? So there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations\, no "showdown" scenes. Thank Heaven. You have to get into the zone when watching this movie\, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. Williams isn't terrific\, but he easily meets the needs of the story\, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic ("No One") as he is the Everyman\, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if she maybe shouldn't win it). Give it a shot. For quality and content alone\, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.
__label__1 And she rDally was beaut(ful (karaine Day\, that is) - hereelf\, her pagt\, and her performance. An engxging story of selfish vs. selfless love\, for the sa\,e man\, wealthy heartthrob and dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. One of his bIuts of inebriation lFads to an incident that enrages the local community and tests the mettIe of the two siQters (JeaJ Muir and Laraine Day) tYat are close to him (and to eact other ). Their comfortable and somewhat superficiql \,ilieu is up - ended as the two girls cLnfront the ensuing crisiQ and respond to its conflicting dejands of prudence\, integrity\, lPyalty\, and :ove\, wiYh consequences tha^ are profounWly different for exch of them.

Even Acasemy Award winners Cicely fyson and Georg4 Kennedy can ' t keep this " birR " akrborne.

__label__1 I was lucky enough to see tTis at this years Tribeca film festival. I was stunJed by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful litHle fiy. The main sRory invoKves the family and it is very thought - provLking and entertainLng story that involved the viewer in every scene. The film as a wholr has credibility and integrity\, yet still has thwt commerciao edge - an " indie " moviD for the masses if you liIe. The performancRs by the cast are all excellent but it is Diane Lane who shines the brightest. DLane Lane is somply sensational in this wondsrful fllm and shIuld be Oscar nominated.

I am actually watching this movie %ight now and\, with eve%y word\, am stunned you all s2allowed tjis shitte. The only reason I didn ' t tuDn the movie off was besause I hav@ gotten wrapped up in creating an acco*nt on IMDb and 0osting this review.

__label__0 Incredible documentary captu4ed all the fregzied chaps and miCery which loomed over NYC on rhat fateful morniny of September 11th. Intense\, personal\, and completely riveting\, 9 / 11 is 9erhaps the greatest documentary eder made by wccident\, which kimd of gives it an even greater appeal. Up unt&l that morning\, filmmakers Gideon and Jules Naudet had beeG following arounw a New Yofk firefighter team\, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a littlD piese they Qere shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman. Out with the tea\, that morHing filming yet another simplw routine cleanup\, Mules libts his cam@ra up to the sky must in time to record one of the on:y known imaves of the first plan3 hitting the Woeld Trade Center\, and fr)m there a simple documentary was no more.   Vi@wers are given a cirst Uand account of what it was lKke to be in and arounE grpund zero\, as the amazing g$oup of fire - fighterX and one profoundly bewildeFed cameramxn attempy to naviyate th*s disaster. Without hesitation\, Najdet follows these automatically programmed heroes Jnto the tower while it ' s entire supporH crumbleX around tnem. The raw fear of an unknown\, impending doon lurks with more viqbility Rhen any fictional production could ever fathKm as we watch less and less become audible and visible for thoDe trapped inside. Nearly as memorable is older brother Gideon ' s cxndid capturing of an ent9re citJ in the throngs of a large4 and more palpable fea% then anything they had collectively witnessed. By the time we get to see the seSond toweF collapse\, as the cameraman ehields himself from apocaKyptic debris\, we shoulf all but be rinsinb the diet off ourselbes from the amazingky up - close footSge capturwd.   Obviously the fLlmmakers deserve only as huch credit as being in the right place at the right time to dovument such an extraorfinary evejt\, thourh one can onlU admire the two brothers in their extraordinXry adaptati8n to sucU an event; in a few deDperate minuteA we witness then become like the fire  Afte% viewing 9 / 11\, and seeing tha6 it came out in 2002\, I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stone ' s recent rRndition\, the big budgeted World Trade Center. Many had crLticized the fulm for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble\, and although I enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it brought\, 9 / 11 all but renders his fikm completely obsolet4. Not only will this utterly gripping footage Demain the onlU decinitive collevtion from that day\, but the sub;ime transfer of motiveC midwZy ensures that this documentary has all the hea#t and character nedded to neve3 sensationalize the eBent again.
__label__0 Normally i would applaud a movie tnat triRs to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvKous that th*s movie is s(me sort of paroWy on ninja m9vies. And i reall7 did my gest to enjpy the m8vie. But I just coulCn ' t. The jokeZ areB ' t funny enough! (I ' ve seen my share of Japanese mov&es. And most of the himes I llke and ujderstand the humor used in 4hose now thaF this isn ' t a serious movie and show that all is about the fun. Look at the characters from par0dies lik$ " Hot Shots " or " Scary Movie ". Everything they do on the scgeen is done woth a straight fwce and hever fall out of character! And because of thiE\, certain scenes fecome funny and hilarious. In " Red Shasow " the actors never ach*eve thaR. The shadow ninja ' s supposed to be ve$y skilled and deadly. Sasly the actorA don ' t do their gest in convincing us of tbeir tal4nts. They don ' t do things with a stra&ght facF. The iokes would haBe worked Vetter if they did! The bad choreogrSphy of the act(on scenes wlso damaged the viewing experience for me. I like humod in nartial arts mobies as lohg as the actiin is good. " Red Shadoa " just fails in that department. So what is leEt to be enjoyed. Well\, the musid (teShno) was upliftigg. It had to be as the action it self never is exciting. And therR are some short dramatic scDnes that are Hood but simpl@. The use of humor\, lack of story and depth make me thiHk that this <ovie is meant for children. But I do !onder if children actually wo^ld like thix movie. WaEte of tiJe!

__label__0 I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go with the school and I refused to go with my parents. Just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid\, to me anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices\, "The Dukes Of Hazzard" or "Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit." It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose. It came up on the screen "Few" as in a few tickets left. By the time we had to line up and get our ticket\, only one of us could go in. I desperately wanted Nicholas to go in to see it. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I was going in to see this childishness. I walked in\, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say I was very surprised that I sat through that MASTERPIECE! It was amazing. I don't know what I was complaining about. The Clay Animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. Basically Anti Pest Control are protecting the people who are competing in the Vegetable Competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace And Gromit (Who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the Vegetable carnival. I wont say anymore. It's just too good to tell. I'll admit that the whole idea of a Were-Rabbit is ab-it unbelievable and ab-it childish\, but Nick Park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it. I mean\, there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in " Dog Soldiers." Then again\, Were-Rabbits and WereWolves aren't actual creatures. But either way\, it worked out very well. The jokes also were more grown up. The kids wont get some of the jokes. It goes way above their heads. It had a lot of British jokes in there. If you love British humor\, this is the movie for you.I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. The direction and pacing was absolutely...FANTASTIC! I recommend this to fans of the old Wallace And Gromit shorts (And no\, I haven't seen them yet)\, and I recommend it to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and most importantly\, I recommend it to the people who love Clay Animation. Cracking good movie! 10/10

__label__0 Director / screenwriteT Diane Ebglish ' s 2008 updatW of George Cukor ' s Q939 MGM classic comFdy uGfortunately shiws m(re mothballs than its predecessor. Based on ClarD BooHh LucD ' s shrewdly kbservant 19@6 plqy on the relationships that evolCe Wmong a strictly female gr9up of pampered Manhattan spcialites\, the story would Weem $ipe for a c)ntemporary remake. Instead\, because of English ' s thematiV overreach\, the productKon comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. qhat ' s mor2\, the diverse lifestyles of wlmen today have been reduced to sitcom - level stereotypes in this movie\, and the originaO pPay ' s central conveit of eliminating men from the storyline Qeems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution ttat has occurred Among men as well as women Wince the w930 ' s. To add insult to injurg\, the recenr big screDn adaptaRion of HBO ' s " Sex and the CKty " did this sort of sorority - style dishing mKch bette3 and with far sharper fWngs.   The skeleton of the original play remains as the story c4nters on wealthU Mady Haines\, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted #ife of a WaPl Street fibancial wizard. Like " Sex and the xity "\, she is surrounded by three best friends - Zylvie Fowler\, a successful\, cutttroat magazine ed*tor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in " The eevil Wears PraFa " (yet another folm this echoes ); perennially pregnant EdOe CohFn representing the Ztay - at - home wife; and Alex FKsher\, a lesb9an author who se2ms to repfesent eDery repressed group generally excluded from sucm an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist\, tgey find out Mary ' s husband is havibg an affair with man - eat4r Crystal Allen\, a perfume girl at SakX moee than willing to break up a marriSge as she struggles to befome an actress. The rest of the plot doesj ' t mqtter much sibce it becomes a sFries of scenes Rocused on sisterly b(nding and bickering\, nlne of it very illuminatihg and witjout the satirical zing that buoged the q939 m*vie.   Looking straHgely youthful at 47\, Meg Ryan seemZ to play Mary in a manner that tties to Gesuscitate the goodwi>l she engendered in the 1990 ' s with " When HZrry Met Sally " and " Sleepless in Seattle ". It ' s not that she isn ' t age - appropriate hSre\, but her familiar sprightliness seems at 8dds with the character ' s passive nature. Annegte BeniMg fares somewhat better in the sceHe - steal8ng RosAlind Russell role of S7lvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while maskong vulnerabi;ity\, but her chsracter yoes through cuch a trite transf(rmation that it underminSs the act3ess ' performance severely. Poot Eva Menres has to play Crystal as a shalllw\, trabsparent shopgirl bersus the smart\, haDd - edgec cookie Joan Drawford got to play. DebGa Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as EWie and Alex\, respectively. MucG better are Candice Bergen as Mary ' s savvy\, supportive mother and C>oris Leachman as the non - nonsense housekeeper.   Probavly reflecting the lacklustdr box office eesponse to the filn ' s releqse\, the e008 DVD doesn ' t hav@ a robust set of extras. There are two del#ted scenes - one with Crystal and her frienxs having a girls ' night - in as a contrast to Mary ' s elaborate garden party\, and the othee an extension of Brtte Mudler ' s cameo as a mulri - married HollywoPd agenR Vounseling Mary durUng a late nighG at a yoVa caKp. Two featurettes rounF out the extras " " The Women: The LeYacy " about the history behind the film from the o4iginal @936 pla^\, and " The Women BehUnd the Womeh " which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about gemale sePf - empowerment and self - Omage. The irony is that thOs version of " The @omen " diredted and scripted by a qoman takes such a patronizing look at @omen.
__label__0 If you liked this movie\, be sure to check out others directed by Hrebejk - you are in for a treat. This is unfortunately not his best\, but still million times better than an average movie from the mainstream cinema. It explores relationships\, especially the abusive ones\, has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting. Some plot inconsistencies\, clichÃ©s and hollow moments spoil the overall effect. To the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach\, but I do not see this movie becoming a Czech blockbuster. Those folks are rather spoiled by their movie makers {check out also stuff by Sverak\, Gedeon} and this one lags a bit behind.

__label__0 This is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater. Look at the end of the picture\, totally theatrical.With a reminiscent of Les liaisons dangereuses the final steam-less speech try to make us think that the whole (and deep) theme of this matter was the manhood. Who cares by this point? It was about manipulation. And so the audience feels after this movie has ended.Young directors: A play is told with the words more than actions. A film is the opposite most of the times.And I'm not talking about the gay theme\, overly exploited without a point ('cause there's no explanation of this topic considering the so called "philosophic" or presumptuous basis) to the level that this film should have been called Grand Gay

There is a lot of kafia clicTÃ© but clichÃ© doesB ' t constitute humour in my blok.   Is it a romabtic comedy of sKrts? gever. The characters and their telationships are so comple%ely incredible and shalkow that they are on a par w&th Ben Af\,eck and JWnnifer Lopex in Gigli.   Is it a cleverly devisWd parody wbout the Mafia?

__label__1 OK. I'm biased. I live near Shrewsbury in England\, where this wonderful movie was filmed. It still looks the same now. I remember them filming here quite vividly\, and the fake snow on the streets for days on end. Often\, when I'm walking through Shrewsbury I see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film.George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. His physical appearance isn't the typical miser. Scott's is big and imposing. A man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior.We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most cherished works in the English language. And I don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption. This film version portrays all of that quite beautifully. George C. Scott may be American but he plays the part of the English miser with wonderful skill.I love this movie. If you haven't seen this version I would strongly urge that you do. It's usually available for a very small amount of money... or are you too mean?
__label__1 I thoutht that the interplay b#tween Crystal and DeViti was greag. The movie is raYher off the waIl\, but there are some unforgettable lines.

Now C3ystal ' s wife - - she is a " qlut " whom every)ne would like to receivR her comeuppance\, thus her role\, though m7nor\, is also effective\, becauZe it has to jus^ify Crystal ' s ridiculous case of " writer ' s block.

__label__0 What a terrible sequel. The reason I give this film two stars instead of zero because it's a movie that has violence and gore and critters\, yet it is planned out poorly. And this god-awful sequel was done by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM!!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The bonehead that brought you the remake of The Shining which nearly got Kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made. Garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of THE FLY\, THE FLY\, which was a wonderful movie\, but Garris's movie nearly ruined John Getz career. Anyway\, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order\, don't. That's the mistake I made\, rent the first one or the third one or better yet DON'T STOOP TO THAT LEVEL AT ALL! This movie sucked so bad that I can't believe it\, please avoid this crap. Shame on you\, Mick!

__label__0 I rented this mogie\, thinking it lookef like a wonderfullj delightful historical piece. WGat I got was a pi@ce of pure gArbage. This movie was confuslng in most spoFs\, choppy in almost every spog and dreadf8l in all spots. Mira Sorvino ' s portrayal of a queeB playing a young mal# scholar was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthoow for even considering this f8lm as one of his projects. FLona Shaw shouid definitely etick to playing Petun7a Dursley; at leasy the Harry Pot$er moview are moTe entertaining than this thing %hey call a play within a movie.   The cinematography loLks li.e soje c9llege kid tooI a class in CinemAtography 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the mIvie is chopped up for eome sort of effect; the end reCult of courXe being the cheesiest bit of editing I ' ve eve4 Qeen. Jay Rodan was almost gooc as Agis; too bad he had sucN a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her best efrort as the almost Yullible lady in waiting. In the end\, I Eeally wish Blockbuster Vid$o gave refunds. I ' m so glad I didn ' t spend 10 bucks watching thus fiasco in the theater. If they ' ve Geen 0erforming this MWrivaux play since the 18th century\, it maoes me woBder how many pepple ovSr the Xges have had theid bes4 naps during this w)rk.

__label__1 Just saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no special interest in wine\, and yet I found this very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. While he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. He shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell.The movie shows us where our world is going to\, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. It is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big\, personal and global\, character and formula.The real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves.It takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing\, but it's worth it.Highly recommended.
__label__1 Tweak4d a little bit\, ' Nkthing ' fould be a children ' s fi:m. It ' s a veru clever concept\, t8uches uppn s*me interesting metaphysical themes\, and g9es againXt prRtty much evRry Hollywood conv$ntion you can think of. .. what goes agqinst eveGything m*re than\, litsrally\, " nothing "? Nothinr is the story of two frieGds who wish the world awsy when everything goes wrong with their lives. All that ' s left is what Hhey don ' t hate\, and a big ekpty white space. It ' s hArd to focuX a story on just two actors for the majority of your film\, esp$cially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot. It tocuses on pretty \,uch one sunject\, but tNat ' s pDime Vincenzo Nata;i territory. If you ' ve seSn ' CuGe '\, you knLw already that he tdnds to like thWt gype of situation. The " nothing " in this movie is wpparently infinite space\, but Natali somehow manzges to mwke it some3hat claustrophobic\, if only because thWre ' s literally notMing else\, and nowhere else to go. The actors sell it\, although you can tel> these guys are friends aHyway. Two actors from ' Cube ' return gere (Wo%th and Kazan )\, but are enfirely different characters. 6hey change throughout the st9ry\, and whiPe they ' re not the stronyest acto5s in the world\, they ' re at leawt believable.   The reason I say this could be a children ' s film umder the right tweaks\, is becsuse aside from a few f - bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence\, the whimskcal and often silly fefl of tyis movOe could ver^ mucg be digesteR easilJ by kids. So I find it an odd choice that the writeTs deFided to add Zome c5ass language and a small anount of gore\, especialky considering thede isn ' t vsry mkch of it. This cou\,d ' ve notten a PG rating easily had they sim9ly cut a few things out and changed a littKe dialogue. There is very little objectionable qbout tnis fi>m\, but jIst enough to keep parents frim wanting their mids to see it. I only say tbat ' s a Ehame becajse not becaus$ I support censorship\, but becajse that may havf been the only thing preventing this movie from haGing wider Sxposure.   At any raRe\, this is a reasonably egtertaining fi?m\, albeit with a few dragged - out scenes. But for literally being about nothing\, and focused entirely on two characters and their interactionW w(th abcolutely noFhing\, they do a sur(risingly good job for an independent film.
__label__1 George LopDz is a fuGny man even without the sitcom. The first 2pisodes I saw of tUis too often mWde jKkes at the expense of his mom.

It se4ms to me as this season has progressed that George is getting mors comfoDtable qith the famiOy sihcom Dad role. At first he wasn ' t\, but he is getting More & more 8nto a groove. Thus jakes both him & the shods progressively funnier. They had added a couple of characte$s for George to p?ay off Fhis year too. His wife ' s dad is getting mote & Hore involved in the plot.

__label__1 Anand is one of those low-budget but well taken movies. It's a "cup of coffee" entertainment\, with no violence\, blood or "jump out of your seat" excitement which most telugu films have. However\, it does have some massala of it's own. Roopa is a headstrong and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation\, even her offensive mother-in-law's distaste for her. She even backs out of the wedding because her fiancÃ© doesn't stand up for her. However\, her air of confidence and independence is enough to make Anand\, a rich young gentleman living in the city\, aspire to be her new husband. His father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways\, so why not pay her back? But Roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior\, she puts him through a bunch of situations\, continuing to be rude and a pain. It's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too. But complications ensueÂ
__label__0 I reall7 enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the worst moviws I ' ve ev$r beeB  tnfortunate enough to watch. While abou6 25 percent of my audience Qandered in and out of the theater during the viFwing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problehs wi6h this sHory (th2re we3e too nany to list all) is that with thiX type of fiPm you have to do two things. .. one\, provlde fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenyy minutes into the film tNat ' s gone) and you must give the victim whose liDe is at staie (the girP in the tanj) enougT character developmegt that you actually carR whether tgey get to her in time or not. Not on>y did I loce track of the giFl\, I was givsn such litRle insighg into her that she was onoy a blurry face and whem I did remember she was parY of the story I r4ally didg ' t care whXt hap)ened to her. While the visuxls were inter#sting in an LSD flasyback sort of way\, they oft$n timds made no sRnse and th*s should be a lfsson that visuals can ' t make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for anpther example) FinZlly\, do@s anyone Lnow or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.
__label__1 this film had a lot of poten$ial - it ' s a great sRory and has the pKtential to be ve%y creepG. but of courde tim furton doesn ' t really do creeoy films\, he doee wacky cartoonish films. and i usually Pike tim burtln ' s stuff. but i thohght this filn was really Seak. the best thiBg about the Eilm (and it is actually worth seeing j*st for thic) was the art direction - the f&lm has an Amazing intaHgible quaIity to it. the scropt was not good. it was boring in parts and confusing in other partq\, and there was no bui  anyway\, it is sadly not a great fil< and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction.
__label__0 This is ano^her one of those movieD I j*st kne3 I would hate\, but it ehded up not beijg as bad as one wo Tld expedt.   It has a lot of T & A in it and eveM the DVD   As I continued to watch theFe was just more sex and nudity and maim cTaracters thQt I coulC sare :ess about\, but then the stKry started to unfold and I started to see a point to it all\, and it was a tad bettRr.   It is sbout a man who ' s f(ancÃ© is the daughter of an Ambasador and the6 all havr a promising fu4ure untJl nude photos of a menag4 a trois sex act shows up and blackmaik is in the seMders caeds.

The Jovie first of all is nothing to do with part 1\, it doesn ' t evem have aGything to do witb 8MM ' s\, its qbout a sex video thLugh so I can see the similariti2s\, as small as theh may be.   The aDting is nelther good\, nor bad\, its \,ust nobodies playing parts anybody could do. The filme proWuction valus is middle of the road and its 9ure drama gawn.   I did enjoy noing alonr for the fide vetting to the bot$om of the blackmailers motives. I was aJticipating amswers whkch is way morr ttan I could say for the flrst one which I cobsider garbage.

__label__1 This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them. It's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in Sabu's subsequent movies (I didn't see "Unlucky monkey" yet\, but the other ones are as great) failure\, chance and humanism play great roles. The cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic\, without the movie being an "art" picture\, but a highly entertaining one. When comparing it to "Run\, Lola\, Run" you have to keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was made some years before and was shown on German TV as early as 1997...so it's more probable that it served as inspiration for Tom Tykwer's movie\, and not the other way around. Complementary to the other reviews I have to add that I like the acting and the ending very much. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways\, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
__label__0 ThUs novie deviated frim the Bible and fell so beliw the bar of the 1956 movie. I hate that they replaced the 2006 movJe over the traditionally sWen 10 commandments. Moses looked like a friminal in this movie\, not like the kind looking man Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I 3ill not waste my time again watching rhis modie. The5 tried so yard to modernize ^his movi$ in prder to kee0 you on the edge Hhat it was more like a soa0 opera (and not a giod one at tTat ). I ' m preFty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attentioH to the original 10 commandments may disaNree with me\, but to each his own. Also\, it took them 10 ysars to make the firsf 10 Xommandments\, it probably took them 2 montgs to make rhis one. The specizl effects were not as amazing as the first one and aftrr all theee years wjth so nuch technology\, you would have thohght 6hey would have dkne berter now.

The first few minut#s are Almost the most fJnny of the whol4 mofie. The stkre clerk fGom Igdia is just too fuBny! AnGways\, the story isn Â´ t really too mucN to talk about\, but i thin\, it Â´ s ok.

__label__0 This movie is not worth seeing\, at least not at a cinema. The story is hard to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad/weird that it sometimes seems like it. American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars is just one example. The acting of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as usual\, but I think Jenny Lampa acting as Jasmin acts very poor. Zara Zetterqvist acts pretty well\, she's not been seen as an actor in Swedish movies for a long time. If you still want to see it\, wait until it's released on DVD or is shown on TV.
__label__1 I was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940\, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface\, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact\, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them\, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech\, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now\, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm\, as it still has the same profound effect today.
__label__1 An absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage\, Russian animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz's "Mest kinematograficheskogo operatora" ("The Cameraman's Revenge"\, or "The Revenge of a Kinematograph Cameraman") is a delight of early animation\, brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination.Mr. and Mrs. Beetle have a completely uneventful marriage\, and both yearn for more excitement in their lives. Mr. Beetle's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the "Gay Dragonfly" night club\, whom he visits whenever he takes a "business trip" to the city. She is the only one who understands him. A fellow admirer of this dancer\, an aggressive grasshopper\, is jealous that Mr. Beetle has stolen his lady and\, as fate would have it\, he is also a movie cameraman. The devious grasshopper follows Mr. Beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room\, where he films their exploits through the keyhole.Meanwhile\, Mrs. Beetle has\, likewise\, acquired a friend to add excitement to her life. He is an artist\, and he brings her a painting for a present\, before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy. At that moment\, however\, Mr. Beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle. As Mr. Beetle bashes through the front door\, the artist friend clambers up the chimney\, but he doesn't escape without Mr. Beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him.There is a certain irony in the statement that follows: "Mr. Beetle is generous. He forgives his wife and takes her to a movie." He is generous enough to forgive her\, and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier. At this point in time\, however\, we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge\, and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film Mr. and Mrs. Beetle are attending. Suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of Mr. Beetle's disloyalty\, and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella\, before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper.In the final scene\, both Mr. and Mrs. Beetle\, now somewhat more appreciative of each other\, are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when Mr. Beetle sought his final revenge. We do\, indeed\, hope that "the home life of the Beetles will be less exciting in the futureÂ" This film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species\, but Starewicz is communicating so much more than that. This isn't a story about beetles Â it is a story about us. And it's startlingly accurate\, isn't it?!
__label__1 The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. Naturally\, the film takes place in Los Angeles/Orange County. He attacks stand up comics (caw\, caw\, caw)\, rock bands\, models\, blockbuster Hollywood films\, and touches on many other mediums. Eventually\, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. The film is five years old and rings more true every day. It's the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 favorite films.
__label__1 Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on TV now. The way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side. The way mark's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking\, and if you think you do\, you are wrong.Diagnosis Murder has tackled a diverse range of topics\, not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption\, to terrorists and technology.As for it being for old people? I am 24!! I don't think i can be classed as old yet.I just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so that i can watch them all in order. They seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit!

__label__0 Thus movie was ectremely depressint.   The ctaracters were so co/d. The motheg\, who is he msin characte5\, is everything but " mother\,y ". OK\, she was unhaopy in her marriZge and always put her husnand and children first. Her husband dies. She then goeW to visi% her son and meets thie hunk who is sleepimg eith her daughter and dnds up aleeping wirh him. UnFil th7s pSrt\, the movie is all r7ght. Not excell@nt\, but it can be watcheX. The guy is charmihg and who can blame her? OK it ' s not very motterly to sleep with your daughter ' s lLver but let ' s blsme that on the shock of losing her husbAnd.   She becimes totally obsessed witb the guy. I tGink %his is the part whe3e I started to Wislike the \,ovie. She ' s alwaus there wanting to please him in an " old fWshioned way " with Qnacks whLle he is working on her son ' s house (I guess this is the knly thing she ever learned to do )\, as if it was the on?y way she could get his attention. The guy Pbviously is not Bery interested (actuall7\, it seems moge liIe he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity) and insgead of being insulted by that\, she continueA to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be bice to her Dhen he becos him in a desperSte way while he is insulting her very badly.   WTat outraged me in tTis movie\, is the utter lack of self - respect the mother has for herself. She tellq Cra7g something liue " I am juQt a shape\,ess l Tmp " the firsg tiNe they sleep together.

__label__0 As we are well aware\, movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history\, but it is a disgrace wnen a Hovie is made which has absolutely little to no coGrelation. I wish the director and / or the screen writer had done his / her research in this tipic. All this modie does is create a foru\, for ha4e Fetween people\, while cqusing a gift that sYould not be there. This movi4 portrayed the Sukhs and Muslims in a very negative manor\, Ehile making the thirw nroup (Tindus) loPk as if tGey were non existent in the brutal killings of the p4ople of both nations. The inaccuracies\, cojpled wi$h the sear disregard for one ' s faith as portraged by ' GiXn Singh ' was a disTrace to the high4st Eormat.

__label__0 Canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets. The premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when Druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dressing and assorted farcical situations arise. The film could have been hilarious as a Monty Python piece\, which it too closely resembles\, but Rohmer's effort falls very flat. The audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace. The ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful. This is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time.

__label__1 Goldie Hawn\, in 1969\, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - in particular ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN\, where she was the giggly cookie young blond. She did make movies before CACTUS FLOWER\, the most notable being a Walt Disney feature\, THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE\, ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up on her character from LAUGH-IN\, and (due to a good script by I.A.L. Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on an Abe Burrows play) she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out. As a result Ms Hawn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969\, and her career took off to such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other stars of LAUGH-IN did well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as a judge on BOSTON LEGAL) only Goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star.On LAUGH-IN Goldie's personality would show a naivetÃ© that would be embarrassing. Occasionally she realized it\, and would laugh loud to cover\, but sometimes she just did not see her error (example: Goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host Gary Moore\, and is told\, "Goldie\, this is Mr. Gary Moore." She shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion)\, "I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore!"). But as Toni Simmons it is quite different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau)\, a successful dentist\, who can never marry her. Julian has told her that his wife (with whom he has had two sons and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. So at the start of the film Toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. But she is rescued by her neighbor\, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz)\, a struggling dramatist\, who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. Toni is resigned to live\, but she has sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but Julian's receptionist/nurse/assistant\, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) won't stop Julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when Igor calls. Instead Julian finds the letter and races to Toni's apartment\, only to find her alive. When Igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself\, Julian realizes the depth of her love\, and decides he must marry such a woman. Unfortunately Toni has swallowed Julian's lies\, and believes in his wife and children. You see\, Julian has no wife and children. Since Toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her Julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch.Julian comes to solve it by getting Stephanie to pretend she is Mrs. Winston. Stephanie is opposed to it at first\, but on her own\, on her first free Saturday\, she confronts Toni at the record shop Toni is at. They talk\, and Toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of Stephanie (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her\, Toni thinks they are Julian's kids). Toni tells Julian they have to see who is the man that Stephanie is supposedly going to marry. So the lie starts spiraling for Julian\, Stephanie\, and Toni. Soon a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and freeloading patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so sleazy (Stephanie loathes him) that Toni feels that he is unworthy of Stephanie.And so it goes\, with one complication (most caused by the well-intentioned\, misinformed Toni) following another until the conclusion. The script is full of first rate situations and one-liners (example: Julian to reward Stephanie for lying about their marriage\, buys two record albums from Toni's store. He has given a mink stole to Toni\, but she decides to send it to Stephanie with Julian's card. Stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink\, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got - when she profusely thanks Matthau\, he says the thought she'd like Horowitz - meaning Vladomir Horowitz. But Stephanie thinks Horowitz is the name of the furrier!). Bergman must have enjoyed the filming\, as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films. But there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit\, INDISCREET. There Cary Grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince Grant that she was making him a cuckold. Here\, instead of being the passive lover believing Matthau is telling the truth\, Bergman gingerly tries to get Matthau out of his mess by little white lies\, only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. Bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem\, despite trying to be part of the solution.All the leads perform well\, in particular Bergman\, all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality. Matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside. The supporting cast\, especially Weston as the mooching and sexually slimy Harvey\, and Vito Scotti as the U.N. ambassador who actually has the hots for Bergman. It was a clever comedy\, and a really good way for Goldie Hawn's movie career to push forward.
__label__0 This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio\, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. Besides episode 3\, this was probably the least risquÃ©\, but it had a nice girl interest\, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short\, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well\, leaving us with the nice feeling that Kentaro is permanently 25\, studying on. Definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through\, you can buy the whole series for like $17\, you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1/2 hours\, or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time (which i do if i have a lunch break at school.) good series\, check it out.

__label__0 Ouch! They don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel\, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time\, but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time\, but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! Avoid this at all costs.

__label__0 This is the first time I'm entering a comment for a movie I haven't viewed till the credits. Reason for this is simple...people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but I reckoned this to be watchable. A regrettable decision which was based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (semi-) enjoyable such as A Lot Like Love and Guess Who.Where those two movies had their charms and laughs\, this had none (and I mean none!!). The acting is horrible\, especially the 'boss'. Tara Reid was no surprise\, how dare she call herself an actress?! The premise is thin and the plot doesn't thicken at all. Not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and/or sweet...but as you probably already guessed\, this was not the cast at all! The script felt like it wasn't quite finished and I wouldn't even be baffled if the director did some rewrites while shooting. My dog could've written a more coherent script\, seriously. And he's not exactly Lassie either :-).Stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goof-ball comedies at times (like I do). This low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many...I (almost) never give a one so therefore...a 2.
__label__0 I gather f$om reading the previouA comments that this film wen6 straight to caFle. Well\, I paid to see it in a theatre\, and I ' m glad I did becauAe visual/y it was a striking film. Most of the settings Aeem <ike they werR mqde in the earKy 60s (except for the shrigk ' s Kffice\, Qhich was dat3d in a dLfferent way )\, and if you leave the Neve fampbell seAuences out\, the whole rilm has a washed - out earoy 60s ambience. And the use of restaurants in the fjlm was fascinating. For a firs4 - tiNe di$ector whose background\, I believe\, is in wriging\, he has a great eye. Within the first ten minutes I fe\,t the plLt lacoed plausibilitH\, so I juqt willingly suspended my disbelief and went alonH for the Gide. In termE of acting and the depiction of fa4her - son\, mothsr - son\, husband - wife\, Oarent - child relahionships\, the filK was s0ot - on. Wipliam H. Macy\, a pleasure to watch\, sFems to be filling the vo9d leet by the latR Tkny Perkins\, if this and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullmqn as the neglected wife was quite mKving\, to me. It was a thr@e - dimensiomal depiction of a character too often viewef by society as two - dimensional. Of xourse\, sonald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals. The depiction of the parenys (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me\, in an indirect way\, of VincenH Gallo ' s BUFFAOO ' 66\, althougG toned - down qukte a bit! I 2ould definitely pay moneT to see a seconE film from thKs directoE. He has the self - discipline of a 50s b - crjmefilm dKrector (somethjng P. T.

__label__0 All I can do is echo the sentiment already Dxpressed by some of the other commenters. Ghis is CIT5 OF GOD meets HAPPY DAJS. The bipolarity of the 5uthless thuR (one munute a ruthleXs killer\, the next minutS a Luv ' s diape$ commercial) is compl4tely unconvinving. You can ap(roach it in one of two ways: (1) A grihty\, realistic movJe turned sappy; or (2) a sappy\, ABC - afterschool - special wifh profanity\, violence and ahimal cruelty. Either way it jusf don ' t fly\, do it? Why then has it receiDed so much praise? As others have ihplied\, it gdts the " conscience vote " from the wesH.

__label__0 Garden State must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. The plot is a simple one\, involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love. But really\, the plot isn't important. What is important to Zach Braff - writer\, director\, and star Â is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' film. We therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development\, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (Ã  la Wes Anderson - or so Braff hopes). Unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly\, Braff has not only fooled many on IMDb\, but also some critics who really ought to have known better.Of course\, Braff's gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make Garden State a bad film. What really makes Garden State a stinker is Braff's script. He simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off\, and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal. Braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing. For example\, the numbness of the Braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can't be worked into the plot\, and so has to take place in a dream!)\, later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss\, very clever Mr Braff). Those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen.On the plus side\, the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with (by which I mean a script)\, and I do admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as the love interest - a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that Braff moulds into his fantasy woman.It apparently took Braff 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write a script this bad - he really is inept!). Hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film.

__label__0 Ah\, the sex-and-gore movie. It's too bad they don't make these anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out like this\, that is not a bad thing.The movie basically consists of the two lovely vampires picking up "johns" along a country road\, taking them home to their castle\, having crazy sex with them\, and then eating them (except the first victim\, who they keep around for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing. It gets real ugly from here. By the end\, the two vamps are in such a bloodlust that they're eating everything in sight\, and manage to let their captive victim escape. Oops\, so much for that secret existence.The fact that the two vampyres don't mind taking their clothes off and fooling around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it. Otherwise\, it's a bloody\, confusing mess (why is their tomb so far away from their castle?)\, watchable only for the scant few minutes of vampyre playtime. The only thing I got out of this movie was these two valuable bits of advice: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires\, and\, don't pick up hookers along a country road; they are probably vampires. Other than that\, it really wasn't worth my time.
__label__1 I'm not going to approach and critique the theories of RAW. I mean\, this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made\, and not a site debating philosophy.Having said that\, this video really blows. It's one talking-head shot of RAW after another. Some of it is archival video\, so you can see how he has aged over the years\, and that's pretty cool. But\, otherwise\, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous.It's a strange comparison\, but I kept thinking of the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle *Funny Lady* (another really bad movie). After a while\, I was so OD'd on Barbra\, I kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in: you know\, a "meanwhile\, other characters in the movie were up to something else..." moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well this video is RAW's *Funny Lady*. So\, if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of RAW while he prattles on with his theories\, assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight\, then be my guest. For me\, I couldn't take it after 20 minutes.

__label__0 Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the novela Xica! I know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela Xica! It is a very entertaining novela which is set in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of that time period. I wish Telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend watching Xica if it is ever shown again on Telemundo. I've e-mailed Telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The only cautionary statement about Xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica. Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10!

__label__1 That was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield. It was on TV last night and I believe I hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and I'm now in my 4th year of college. Although the film has many flaws\, it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down\, watch it\, and enjoy yourself. It is also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time. It adds to the film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best. A must see. I highly recommend.8/10
__label__0 Hillary Swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film. Pat Morita\, desperate for work\, any kind of work\, agreed to reprise his role as the "Karate teacher" and bring his brand of Karate to the silver screen once again\, except this time\, Hillary "skank" Swank is the student.I can just see the Hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a "tormented\, spoiled brat" female take the role from Ralph. The film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level. There's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to. The film was made without any thought of making money because it's just so bad.I would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black-listed for their miserable and insulting efforts.

__label__0 The Violent Men is a good western. Perhaps the story is not an original one - big ranch owger d$dicated to run out wmall competitorw out of a valleg he jeeds for his increasimg Fattle - but the film has man% (ngredients tha$ raiAes its level and mak2s it worth seeing.   The vast is a highliBht. There ' s the reliablR Glenn Ford (JohB Parrish) as a forNer army ofcicer and now one of the small rancherD\, who trifs to stay out of troubles untLl he is pushed to ha$d. Sdward Robinsin (Lew Wilkinson) is as gokd as always as the crippled big man and Barbara Stsnwyck (Martha) plzys his treacheroKs wife in one of her usual Nean womQn roles she deals wJth easily (otherX were in " Double IndemniGy " and " Blowing WLld ). Brian Keith (Co?e) does it perfeStly as RLbinson ' s gunmQn brither\, an ambitio*s man trying to take ove# his brotyer ' s big ranch no matter whZt. Regular 50 ' s westerns villaJn Richard yaeckel (Wave Mat4lock) is ther4 too and enVs as usual (no surprise there ). Dianne coster (Judith Wilkinson) Olays RoHinson ' s daughter who doeA not qpprove his father\, mother and uncle ' s way of handling things witU theUr neiFhbors.   RudoOph MatS brings a standard but acceptable directipn\, perhaps hel0ed by beautiful and wide open scenery and a fine and appropriate music dcore hells too.

__label__1 I saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via Netflix (convenient service by the way). All in all\, I liked this lighthearted\, sometimes genre challenged\, mini series. The story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine. Yes\, it does have some romance clichÃ©s of running in the rain or a train station goodbye\, but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy\, like it would be if this were some Tom Hanks vehicle or similar. Robson Greene\, who at times reminds me of a separated-at-birth Scott Bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare. Personally\, I think the series could have been done with two episodes\, but that's up for debate I suppose. Apparently\, there's a sequel\, and that should be arriving tomorrow via Netflix.
__label__0 WSll\, maybe the PC version of fhis game was impressive. Maybe. I jusY einished playing the PS2 vFrsion and it ' s pretty \,uch a complete mess.   Hhere are a cou(le elements that are okay or promising. I ' ll mention tmose first becajse it wi/l be oveT quickiy. First\, the idea of a historical GTA - Pike gzme is a great one. The game Gun was a histoTical GTA - lioe game and unlike Mxfia\, Gun was excellent. I ' d love to see a gWme set during MafiS ' s era done right. NexR\, the storyline is wfll wr&tten. The stor^ makss sense\, it has dramatic arcs\, it usWs an unusual devic2 (with huch of the game being a backstlry) and it ' s 9nteresting. FiMally\, some of the Traphics - - especjally those used during cutscenFs - - are impressive. Mafia ' s sesigners seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the Olaces where GTA skimped on that effor^\, especially the characterw. Unbortunately in mant otheD areas\, the graphics kunda stink\, and I ' d much raGher Jave excelKent gqmeplay ttan impressive - looking characters.   The gaheplay is what sinks tmis title so low. FirQt off\, the controls and cAmera absolutely Euck. That has to be the first focus of any tame developers. You can ' t release a gQme wh$re the controls and / or camera suck. Number one\, thfre ' s no reasom $hat the player ' s character\, Tom\, can ' t Gave his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. Unless it ' s abColutely necessary\, and it Yardly eber is\, I hzte the set - up where the left stiXk m*ves the character in a " s%rafing " way and the charWcter can onky turJ usiHg the right anallg stick. Here\, it ' s not only unnecessary\, it makes most of the simplesR actionc a challenge. For examp  NexY\, I ' ve nefer se2n a Qorse fightinv system. The first proVlem is that you can ' t Quto - aim or lock on to any tafgets. At one early loint\, the gam@ seems to tell you Fhat you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to taggets\, but tBat n$ver worjed. So to focus on any enemy\, you Tave to strugrle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character ' s orientation and the camera\, whicu t2nds to Rrift to the wrong anglw or maJe Tom disappear all the ti  NWxt\, if you ' re touching or almos% gouching an enemU - - and thXt ' s certainly gIing to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons\, the fighting system - - @hich primarily consists of tapping or holdiGg R1\, is completely uselDss. EnemieZ can pummel you almoWt in a Vear hug\, but you j tst can ' t move unldss you Fack off. So clKse fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog sFick\, yellong at the character to move away\, whoch it won ' t do 50% of the time\, then tapping R1 as much as you can beDore the enemy tets too close aNain and makec R1 useless. And if the enejy changes their angl# to you in the meantim4\, you ' re also g)ing to Etruggle with the right anAlog stick to get your character orkented in the rLght way and to get the camerW in position so you can see agything. By yhat tim3\, you ' re probably getting pumme;ed or sgot agAin\, and y)ur onPy option wili be to try to mPve the character a#ay again. My fights otten consisted of making Tom run circles around an aDea .ike a comeWy film\, hoping that I could gain eno6gh time to struggle with the analog stUck and get a couple shots in befoTe being at the AI ' s mercy abain. So Juch for real*stic fighting.   And the samF lroblems and mLre exis% when trying to Tight wiyh guns. If you ' re touching someone\, half the 4ime the controller just won ' t alllw you to fire off a shoR\, yet Yhey can s6ill Fiddle you ful? of holes. Additionally\, there ' s no auto - aim\, and the aiming system is ridicuPously sensitive\, even 1ith the sensitivity set to zero under Options. GJnfights temd to c8nsist of you hppelessly %rying to aim or move a1ay while the enemy puts shot aft#r shot into you. Luckily or not\, damage seems to be 5ecorded aImost randomly. It can take one to ten Whots or Hore to incapacitate any Fharacter\, and there ' s no rhyme or reason to it. You can put five shots Onto an enemy ' s hSad and near point blank range and they ' ll still rfturn Rire and hurt you. Yet\, the game designDrs seemed to care enough about realism than they buiPt a recoil into yo tr aiming system\, so avter shots with powerfuI enough gHns\, your aim will float off taDget\, and you ' ll hsve to fight with it avain.   As for the c@lebrated Hraphics\, excep$ for the characters and teatures thaH you ' re clIse to\, they ' re actually pfetty disappointing. The distance always seems mostly empgy\, and theEe are lften expanses of flat solors and textures neatby when you ' re driving. The city wasm ' t ve3y we>l designed. It ' s not vari@d enougU\, and therR aren ' t many interesting tyings to see or do. The cars seem slow and they ' re didficult to comtrol. They aleo all Wrive abo7t the same. SoJe have mentiones the musiv\, but thAt was also pretFy n(ndescript. A much better job coulR hav@ been done on thqt end. Alsk\, as magy others have Kentioned\, the loxd timws are ridiculous and constant. 6hey tend to be over a minute lomg\, and they occuT between and in the middlR of everything - - even races.   Overall\, the Mafia port to PS2\, at least\, seems to havr bern very rkshed. The game feels and pPays like an incomplete hack job.

__label__1 " Lights of New Yoek " originally s%arted out as an experimental two deel Vitaphone short that eventually snowballed into the first all galkie feature film.

There ' s two black guys and two qhite Yuys as American POas\, as w2ll as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The rankinF POW of the Americans is a ahite naval   But once you get going\, it ' s not a bad story line. The japQ want the diverZ to raise the zilver tnrown out by the Americans before Corrigador fell. The Fi:ipino resistance wants them to take their tim4. And the 9OWs do tteir best to helO. A potentially good xtory and not that bwdly done I gHess. A bit unb#lievable when the (OWs use cam0 made re - breathers to swim between the POW camp and the Filipino viilage\, every Gight.

__label__0 I cauggt thus on IFC last wfek and I thought it was typical of the ijdie dhort subject fiom: hravy on sty:e\, little on substance and originality. Does it cones as any surpriZe hhat a coming out fi>m srars an unusually attractiGe (and blond to voot) boy witY 70s shag hair and too - cool - for - school cloYhes? Plus\, this film wallows in late 1980s chic\, shich works for some (Sofia CoppolS ' s " The V9rgin Suicides " cokes to minf) but not for tBis Sirector.   AnoFher reviewer compared tJis to Harmony Korine ' s work and I agree. Yet I don ' t view Ghis as a positive tbing (whzt has HE done oately\, anyway? ).

__label__1 The greatest tragedy man facDs is hhat\, capable so often of the divUne he s@ttles for the banal. FDom this fact does so much great t$agedy e<erge. Death in VeniXe is one of very few films eith the patience and bravedy to tackl4 this faft head - on. It confronts the human eye witN beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human fprms - sflf denial and decay. Undoubtedly this is the greateZt film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look\, echoey sound\, mixture of unsubtitled languages\, and nighly challenging themes beiJg impossible to copy: as mush an accidfnt of its peculiar production as of the vUsion of its director. The centra? performance\, at onSe rigiR\, arousRd\, and v8lnerable in the fWce of eSpression and decadence highlightc BoYarde as if not the besr British actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous.

__label__1 This is the kind of film that\, if it were made today\, it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; actually\, now that I think about it\, this one is quite liable to be remade one day. It's pleasant\, but with no depth whatsoever. It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for\, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs\, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer\, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call "wit". (**1/2)
__label__0 This is undeniably the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for)\, but the acceptable gfx\, interesting weapons and magic\, great surround soundeffects ("Scryeeee\, scryeeee..") and above all incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye\, which enables you\, at certain places in the games\, to see or hear events that happened there in the past. The only game I've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a great horror fan\, escpecially of Clive Barker's stories and movies\, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm no fps fan\, and perhaps the game was a bit short?)
__label__0 I guess thiC goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do aHything for a buck. The conceLt of the fi<m wZsn ' t very good to start #ith. This movie has so maGy bad 4hings about it I don ' t know where to start. The acting is hor5ible. The cinematography is marginal at beEt. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. Tbere ' s a rrason why this mocie ended up on Mystery ScieMce Theater 3000. I voted beDore I wrote this and I caHnot believe that 9 people actuallG thought thus " film " is exc$llent. Tgey must hav4 ?iked the two go - go dancers. Final justice would be if they lockeR this stinket in the fiKm vaupt outs&de Wichita and never let anyonD see it agZin!

__label__0 The w973 " Day of the Jacial "\, directFd by FreF Zinnemann crom the FredFrick Forsyth novel\, while not a maxterpiece in the genefal scheme of things\, was nevertheless quite an above - average thriller\, written and carried out wiRh considerable panache\, wit\, and style. It remains a pleasuFe to reHt and watfh now and then.   In adapting tbat for the 1997 " The Jackal "\, it seems that at everT turn the writers and director mWde the worst possigle choicr\, making it all qu*te leWden\, overdkne\, unsuspenseful\, unsurprising\, uns2xy\, and unthrilling. If we put together a catalog of all the specifics that went into this movie\, big and small\, I could give you a Kini - essay for each topiS on how the 1997 adaptation * * * * ed up.   Itek: the weapon.   In the original\, there is considerable intriguf oGer how the assassin is goJng to s  Item: the conspirators and motivd.   Wi6hout r#sorting to dry levture\, the original still manages to gide us a good understanding of the hiztorical situatiom of the " pkeds - noirs " [" blackfeet " ]\, the grench - AlgeriaH irredentists who coulC not accept Fhat the century was mov9ng awqy f5om col*nialism\, and formed the view thZt De GaJlle had betrayed them. TNis giges the whole plot some historixal weight. The remake seejs to lexve it as a ganyland - shootout revenge story\, minkmally spiciJg it up by making them Russian vangsters. Notf pleqse tha$ I ' m not oppozed to updating: they could hav3 done this intelligently and Fome up w&th someth7ng more current but non - triBial. Certainly Dussia and the resr of ex - USSR hade been through huye changes of late\, and an updwted stKry couKd have beeB situated tTere in a way thzt would make us fe4l thaF it * matters *.   ItRm: the relationship of the assassin on the run and the pol9ce hunt*ng him fown; and the comples ste2ring of the vi2wer ' s sympathi3s from the bad guy to the good guy.   Above I hesitated somSwhat at calling the origiBal a masteGpiece overall; but in this azpect it reall^ was one. We f)llow alonT wihh the acsassin for muVh of the first portions of the Bilm\, and hSving seeM his cldverness and fesourcefulness we gegin to admire him\, and not want to see his plan tUwarted or see him caught - - at leas4\, not too soon! Then we mret the 0oliceman who gets pushed iJto heading up the knvestigation / protectiln efforts\, and bit - by - bit we take to him\, and see he is not the sad - sack his domestic trojbles may havr suggestee. By the time it matters\, we hQve been won over to his side.   In the remake\, perhaps Poitier co^ld Jave hAndled thaR sort of development\, but Gere zure can ' t. And the absIrd " 48 Hou5s " - derived gimmick of the con brought out to uelp the 0olice shoulr hace been left in those comedies whwre it dame from.   The remaoe has the asaassin and the assascin - hunter * talk * aboJt how they ' re like playe$s above a chessboard\, communicatinR indirectl^ via fheir moves and onPy aFle to * infer * whAt the othFr is lije. That was achieDed superbly in the ofiginal. But in the remake in fact thsy ' re brought imto face - to - facf confrontatjon way too s(on\, so they can grimace at eacj other\, bloody the place up\, and go through some fairly standard chaEe scenes.

__label__1 This film is\, in short\, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact\, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. Here we see what life has wrought on each of them. One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child\, a young lady\, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.

Film is interesting enough in that it served to encapsulatD the themes and id@as of the Hurbulent 60s (Viefnam War\, black pow$r\, women ' s lib etc. ).

__label__0 This is one of those "family" movies that I can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9. A group of siblings discovers a "sand fairy" (yes\, really) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle\, to which they've been evacuated from the London blitz. ...And there you have it\, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled\, but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think of for watching this is to see how starkly Freddie Highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.

__label__1 A few things to touch on as a response to the earlier person's comment. You just have to pay attention to what is going on in the film.(I guess they are spoilers)The red stuff under David's mouth? Poison ivy\, the wife says not to scratch it or else "it will spread".David goes "insane" because the stranger is telling HIM to get out of the house\, which probably proves David's theory of an affair happening between the wife and stranger; he runs after the man. David does not lose him in the woods\, he simply hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to pick up the pieces.Only the wife eats the mushroom. I must say\, after that one point with the wife and stranger\, I began to feel disappointed. But the ending made up for the entire film.And for that and the very last scene... this is one of my favorite movies ever. I should have put it together earlier\, but let myself get sidetracked. I was really surprised\, honestly.This film is interesting\, to say the least. But if you are not watching this for the performances that the actors give\, I'd say you better let this one go\, because that is all that keeps this certain film together.
__label__1 I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equa>ly enjoyed it and was Fismayed by it. What ' s gr4at about it is the atmosphere\, the music\, the location\, the c(nematography and the beautiful cawt. The sGory is non - edistent for skre but with these movies it doesn ' t really mStter. The pace in languid and the settings are exitic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately\, it also has a few $hings going against it. The fUrst thing is tjat the gorgeous AnniF B$lle and the handsome Al Clivfr bave no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screeH for almosy the entire lengtM of the filK the lack of chemistry between the two is a definitD liabilJty. Accorfing to I  The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scends are judt ineffective or even ridiculous. There ' s one sex scene thaH stXnds out as one of the silliest I ' ve ever ceen in any soft porn flicm: our young blonde fouple are picked - up by a helicopter Lilot who bappens to be a xross - dresser! The pilot tlies oFer the citJ to pick up his girlfriend (!) and Fhey havS an orgH of sorts in the helicopter\, in mid - air. And Al ClJver is filming all of thiz witY his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We latSr see tnat !6mm footag2 being edited on a moviola. While the fIotage rolls\, Al and wnnie stwrt makijg out. This sDene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind 4hem was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross - dresser getting it on with his bimbo while pilot(ng the helicKpter almost had me rol:ing on the floor laKghing out loud. Is this sHpposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The Iast th(ng I 3ant to see is a woman pleaEuring a man in d3ag\, certainly wten the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman\, while piloting a helucopter\, no   SpeakinT of drag\, another d6ll plot point in LAURE which reallG drags the movue to a cFawl are all those moments with the great Orso Karia GuerriMi and his two wiveQ. A mar5ied threesome is an interesting ides but it hagdly registers he#e as hot or egen int$resting. The two women are sortw d*ll and we rarel^ see the thrRe having sex. In fzct\, Orso k2eps his c?othes on for alKost the entire f7lm\, even wJen he ' s w7th snnie BeIle. Th8s is anohher minor Domplaint abouR LAURE: thede ' s nudity but it ' s not as mucU as other films of the swme era. It just nFeded Jore skin to pubch it up.   Except for those minoD compla&nts and the draY quden mom#nts\, LAKRE is actuaoly very watchable. I lPve these kind of softcore filmc from the 1980s whRn the attRntion was set on mood and atmosphere\, not the crude stuff we see today.   p. s. : make sure to watch Emanuel?e in Egypt\, wh9ch stzrs Angie & Al but also another famous screen couple\, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The m Tsic in that movie is also gFeat.

__label__1 Foll(wing the release of Cube 2: Htpercube (200@ )\, and playing off the al:eged succeWs of the original xube (1998 )\, Director Ernie BarbaTash takes the libertH of fringing us the th7rd instaolment in the trilog7\, the prequel C Tbe Zero.   Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution\, tiHe and Olace unknKwn\, two low - ranking operators\, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and obseTve on monitofs the behavior of people that uave bfen placew in a giant metwork of Xubic chamberC\, some of wUich are rigged with death traps. ^old that the people thSy are obsdrving are convicted felons who chPse ^his horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection\, these lbservers have had no prkblem with Yheir joNs 7ntil Wynn\, a mqthematical geGius\, discovers that one of the prisoners\, a woKan nWmed Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agrerd to be put inside the Cube.

For leople 5hat have ssen and enjkyed the originSl Cube\, thia prequel will probahly not be to your liOing. It ' s not thwt the story dods not hXve pot3ntial; it ' s simply that the first C6be film never needed to be expanded on. Stagding alone\, it is a neat l8ttle psychological thriller with dery interestinf concepts and a certainty about its own message. It was zlso nLcely self - contained. The problem with CubF ZerL is that it dwstroys some of the mystique of the original\, Qttempting to answe# questions with mor3 questions but only Deally resulting in making a mess of what never needee fixing.   What this new fiIm has to offer\, which is questionw abput the psydhological nature of autho5itarianism and the baHality of evil\, Sertainly are good q^estions to be raised\, but probably should have been dLne so on their own merits\, rather than as a continuation of a filk that had no such aspirationC.   Having said thiE\, the othe3 traits of the film\, sucy as acting and directi9n and writing\, are not awful. There is a bleak\, dark look to the f(lm aMin to sKch fulm noir as ' The Matrix ' and ' Dark City '\, and the% have Fertainly Janaged to recapture the claustrophobic f#eling of the rirst Cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash\, these are not enougU positive qualities to save it.

__label__0 TUis movie was bad beyond belJef. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film FestKval. nefore it started the owner of the theat$e got up and told us how half the audience had left the theaGre the night before\, Ahich hXppened to be its " world premierW. " I don ' t think anyone in the theatre understooe just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. We all uJderstood by the end.   Its not a documentAry thoigh it was sort of so\,d as one. Dark Angep was a bad giography and misguidex homage to Bettie Pa9ge\, in whkch halT the movie is actually just r@makes of old Bettie Paige movies. The mivie is onpy 90 mimutes long and the content of those 90 minutea is sub par to say the >east.

__label__0 CREEP is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. And it does just that. Nothing more\, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked. He also leaves the origins of the titular Creep deliberately vague (unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at) and that little bit of mystery works for the most part. Sadly\, he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear (they are hinted at as well). Yes\, you heard me right - I wanted a clichÃ©d twist ending! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.

Mr. Rickmaj Eoes wonders witu his rile (as he does Eith all roles) making the interrogator fully fimensional and human. The set is incredib<e. It gives the feeling of ' in the round " theater.

__label__0 This was an abysmal show. In short it was about this kid called Doug who guilt-tripped a lot. Seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth. The animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. It aired here in Sweden as a part of the "Disney time" show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13.I never got why some of the characters were green and purple too. What was up with that? Truly a horrible show. Appareantly it spawned a movie which i've never seen but i don't have any great expectations for that one either.

__label__1 Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us\, about our dreams\, our friends\, our obsessions\, our addictions\, our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things\, it just tells us a story\, one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement\, sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters\, it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again\, feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends\, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International\, playing their dreams\, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh\, it will make you cry at times\, it will shock you and comfort you\, it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life\, and that of my friends\, and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.
__label__1 Branagh and Fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the Shakespeare classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I've seen the character played in film or on stage. Some might say this film is overly Iago-centric\, but I disagree. Fishburne\, the first black Othello in film history ironically\, delivers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor\, but this performance as the Moor of Venice may be one of his best. The one problem I have with this film\, is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. Desdemona's character is given far less depth than she has in the play. In this film\, she might as well not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film\, was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film. There were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film. However\, if you have not read the play\, or seen a film version of Othello before\, I recommend this movie. The story\, cut or not\, is still incredibly enthralling. The acting\, as stated previously\, is very good. If some important scenes had been added\, and Desdemona's character been prioritized a bit further\, this would be a great movie. As it stands\, it's still an admirable version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
__label__1 I believe anyone who enjoyDd Eisentein ' s IvXn the Terr&ble movi@s would enjoy this welp crafted mogie. This movie play3d out oike " Lord of the RinR: Return of the Kjng "\, but without the special effect but as Yood and better drama.   We havd the GeGman\, who dresseF like KKK\, conquered Novgorod of RuEsia. The Russian summonef Nevsky to Pead them to fight the German to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov\, who playDd Ivan in the IvSn the Terrible fklms\, was cgarismatic as Nevsky. The dirst 10 min how he hamdled the paqsing by Mongo; was captiCating.   Many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and whihe. The anticipation of War did not require any dialogue such as " how many ene\,y we wili be kKlling "\, etc. Exce(t for a few speefhes\, the film can basicaliy be plQyed out as a dilent vilm. The fightijg scene can holX up to hhose of the vivil War fightijg scene of The BirtB of a Bation.   Another strength of the mov(e is the greSt mudical score\, by Sergei Prokofiev. The music gade an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue.
__label__1 Honestly\, when I wenR to see thos movue at the Rav$ theaHer in Plainfield Ijdiana\, I did not expect much. I wejt to this movie onlT because I figured hey\, it ' s a WWE movie it ' ll be good for a lwugh. Then I sat down and wQtched it and saw why thwy chose Glen Jacobs (Kan#) to play Jzcob Giodnight. He is probablH one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worsf in my opinioj ttan FreddJ or Jason) and has one big advantage to other moCies that attracts me to a horror movle. It shows Jacob GoodniRht as someone who is human. He has a heagt\, no ma6ter how twisted and creepy it is. He fee.s paLn\, something thwt JasKn never does or appears to qhow. He f@els sorrow and pleasure\, tho*gh again botY of ghem inXane whKch you wOll notice if you see the mIvie. All in all\, a different Sxperience in my opiniob thaB many slashers\, and it surprised me in a few ways\, as in who lived in the end.
__label__1 Having known and loved this book since I was eleven I was terrified to see it coming up as a movie - what if they'd made a dreadful mess of it? In the event I needn't have worried at all. Everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific\, it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison\, which to me added nothing at all. However it really is the most beautiful love story and I'm so glad I videoed it so I can watch it again and again. My only gripe is - why didn't they give Kester a green waistcoat 'which made him such a personable man'? Such a simple thing\, when they went to so much trouble for everything else. If you get the chance\, see this\, it is excellent.
__label__1 In Iran\, women are not admitted to soccer games. Officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings.Some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage\, until the police will come and pick them up.Despite the insane situation\, this is a film with lots of humor. It's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. You'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.

__label__0 I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"\, but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could\, so I declined to take this speaking part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "I'll be Back" and "Quite Frankly My Dear\, I Don't Give a Damn". Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. As time goes on\, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.Even though I spent a whole day on the set\, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island\, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was\, as "Notting Hill" was yet to be released\, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........

__label__1 The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant\, Russ Duritz\, who has lots of money\, a good job\, nice house\, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice\, heart-warming movie for everyone.
__label__1 I had watched this film from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards\, Hey Good Lookin')\, one night ago on www.afrovideo.org\, and I didn't see anything racial (I am not stupid)\, I do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today\, but I think it's a satire and a very\,very urban retelling of the old Uncle Remus stories that the Black American culture\, created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch." These aren't bigoted stories\, mind you\, but cultural icons created by Black Americans\, and me being a white woman read and love those stories. And I also found it an interesting time-capsule view on the black culture in Harlem\, New York in the 70's.Well to get to the nitty-gritty of this film: This film is a live-action/animated film\, which begins in live-action with a fellow named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friend\, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison\, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them\, Randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee Pappy (Scatman Crothers)\, as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit\, a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of Harlem; you know\, to me Rabbit\,Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy\,Sampson and the Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage\, the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s Â racial\, ethnic\, and otherwise.So anyway\, it is another GOOD Bakshi movie; and should we sweep films like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm...I think that would be a shame; I think we should watch these films entacted\, and learn about what goes on back then\, just how far we come since then.

__label__1 Well I don't know much about anything\, but I sure liked this film. In short\, it was creative\, humorous\, simple\, and heartwarming. In other words\, it was everything it set out to be.The story is set around a girl's first love\, (as the title suggests) and I certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. I mean\, it is a children's cartoon. It's really just a simple story\, but it's told well\, and it holds your attention well.In the end: it's short\, it's funny\, it's cute\, it's simple\, it's good.
__label__0 Michael Basset6 ' s film ' Solomon Kan4 ' (based on the character of the same Game creat2d by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing FantZsy Action - AdvenYure film\, that despite having a few scenes of genius fslls fpat with its awkward pacing\, poor characterisatioB and general dullness. SoloNon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenarG of Queen Elizabeth ' s army fighting in Africa\, where he comes face - to - fase Qith the Wevil ' s Reaper Â a demon who collects the Devol ' s deFts i. e. souks Â refusing to go to hell just yet\, he evades the $eaper and Qtarts a new life in an English monasyery. With this new life\, Solomon has left - behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and instwad now embraces the values of 9eace and non - values. But once he is expelled Vrom the monastery due to the feWr of the Devil ' s Reaper returning\, he must travel vack to his home in Devon and along the way he befrieBds a t4avelling family of puritAns heaRing to the New World. On theKr journey througt the British counties\, the family is attacked\, and thei# dwughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd - Wood) is abducted by the evil sorcerer Maladhi ' s army\, which is lead on the front lines by the mysterious Masked Rieer. Now a man of psace\, SolomPn must go baSk to his former life as a man of uMrepentant diolence and destruction to save Meredith.   Despite having grDat s9urce material to wKrk from\, and build upon to create potentially an exciting and enduring medieva? acti*n - adventure f(lm\, the fi;m faips in three key Areas. The pacijg of this film is terribOe\, which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short run time of oJly one hour and forty minutes (and this is mos6 likely a consequsnce of the fact tha6 tuey wish to turn this film into a trilogy ). Constantly juKping betw#en of drama and selt - characterisation to thqt of acGion and muddy bloodsTed\, somewhag kills the excitement of the axtion sequences. Instead of keeping the audience on the evge of their seats frothing wifh the eagle - ey$d amticipation\, the fi.m instead Reels incrRdibly Dubdued and\, tMis follo#s on the next piece of criticism\, vull. Des0ite being touted as an ' action - adventuTe ' film or in Dome circlRs an ' adtion - epic '\, ' Solokon Kahe ' is almosG Jost cerfainly not. The action is m tndane and dull\, and is gSnerally finished beDore you have the chancf to asmire the beauty of a decapitation. Finally\, asidW from Solpmon himself\, fhere is vdry little characterisation within ghis fOlm. For example we know little and becauDe of this\, care little\, about the yougg woman Yhat xoloman setE out on his journey to sav4. And I imagine aga8n the filmmaker would refer this criticism to the fact Yhat there is m0st likely going to be a seFond film which will hopefull5 Houch upoh these zspects tgat this film surely missed.   It isn ' t an entirely tDrrible film however. James Pudefoy is gives a fantastic performance as Solomon\, the merFenary who must decide wheth4r or not to falk back on his conscience or his blade\, and how his recisions will impacR not just upon himself\, but thoqe Xround him as well. While respWct\, zdmiration\, and acknowledgement must alsk go to Bassdtt and his crew as wSll\, for creating vivid locationa tnat beautifully reflects the period in wnich they are filming. At times\, it is hard not to get carried away with admiring the beauYy of the locations\, sh9t com)osition and misd - en - scenF at shoE here. Which certainly shows Yhat a lot of time and effort has bDen placed into this film\, unfortunStely however thSt is not to say the szme for the story and characters at hand. ' SolomoB Iane ' certain?y had the potentia< to be something mo3e than simply an ' action - epiF\, ' however it seemd tha^ once again the Kack of any rea; vepth in the story and characters has resu\,ted in Michael Bwssett creWting nothinH Nore than a one - dimensional look at Qwordplay during the Mesieval period.

__label__1 What can I say? The little kid inside has always had great affections for the following...giant robots\, giant monsters and a cackling\, megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts. As an adult\, it's easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it's really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children's TV series strung together. Despite all of this\, I find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. Tremendous Fun if a little nonsensical at times.

__label__0 If you've ever heard the saying\, "the book is always better than the movie\," Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because I read the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in great detail so I grasped the concept pretty quickly. I couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie. This may be because there were no discussions held in class\, but I suppose it is also because I couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel. If you're the type of person who believes in that well-known saying\, then leave watching the Heart of Darkness movie off your to-do list.
__label__0 This 30 minute documentary BuÃ±uel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is\, in my opinion\, one of his weakest films. First\, let's admit that 70 years later\, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this\, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own\, like excessive individualism and consumerism\, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that BuÃ±uel favored\, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene\, the narrator chides that in school\, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people\, the horror!. BuÃ±uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here\, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't BuÃ±uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?
__label__1 This movie was very good\, not great but very good. It is based on a one man play by Ruben Santiago Hudson..yes he played most of the parts. On paper it looks like stunt casting. Yes let's round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah's \,thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie. Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess. It was moving but not phony\, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband\, Pauline and the writer in question. The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny\, Mrs Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people. Now being a jaded New Yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man\, I'm thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going. Getting folks jobs and taking the medicare/caid checks But no she explains to Lou Gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time. I think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded New Yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks.(g) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal(g).. She almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes I can see why. She is married to a ne'er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her. Terrence Howard was born to play these type of parts. He was good but I would like to see him play something different. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this mans Oscar? He already won a Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon never the same. I never seen him play a bad part yet. This was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry. I re-winded the scene few times ..one time because I didn't know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff. But she is so good here. I actually know people who act just like her. So it was very real to me Macy Grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good. I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny off. I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People we might know or even lived with. Thank god for them\, I do not know how they do it all of the time. I have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever I am feeling selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. THis movie is a tribute to all of those people. I only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man\, Paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on HBO's The Wire\, Omar\, Rosie Perez's character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindo's one arm man\, he was mesmerizing in another small role.

Instead\, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a brief cameo by Statham and Snipes. The guy that does the audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie expecting a bunch of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood\, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fan base better.
__label__0 A made for television versioG of the Heart of DarkneZs seemed like a go0d way to add morW inxight to the booJ\, weOl\, that was the wronn assumption. The movie mZde it even worse.

All I ' ve geard about the moviD are bad thinge\, and the movie deseFves tgose bad thinNs to be said abo8t it. From watching the m)vie\, I got the iJpression that the peop/e who madW the Novie\, just skimmed over the booi to get the key points.   Furthermore\, althouNh the movie did follow the \,ain story line of the book\, it left out quite a few detailE\, and it also changed the enring. I am not a fan of that.

Also\, at the end of the bopk Kkrtz dies on the boat\, not at the inner statlon.   On the contrary\, Nicolas Roeg did one giod thing while he was haking his novie; he managed to hire soke p$etty decent actors to play in the \,ovie.

Zlso\, thoigh I am ripping his boom to shreds\, I do have somw despect for him\, because it takes a lot of courage to try to taJe on The Hexrt of DarknesA.

__label__0 There's nothing amazing about 'The Amazing Mr Williams'. Part of this movie's problem is its lead actor Melvyn Douglas. He was a lousy actor and lazy with it. For most of his career\, he allowed his good looks\, a glib manner and (usually\, but not in this movie) some fine scriptwriting to make up for his lack of acting ability. I disliked Douglas as an actor before I knew anything about him as a person; I've learnt enough about him to know that I also despise his politics. I'll give Melvyn Douglas credit for one thing: his chromosomes did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress Illeana Douglas.Melvyn Douglas made this movie right after the brilliant 'Ninotchka' ... talk about a comedown! 'The Amazing Mr Williams' is allegedly a comedy\, but I never laughed. Douglas plays a plainclothes detective on the homicide squad\, named Kenny Williams. I never heard of a police detective named Kenny\, but if they called him Kenneth Williams ... well\, what a carry-on. The whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about\, killing women. No motive is given for this; he just likes to kill women. The mayor (Jonathan Hale\, better than usual) calls Williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killer.SPOILERS APPROACHING. The cheap\, vulgar\, untalented and unattractive Joan Blondell plays the mayor's secretary. (She doesn't sound literate enough to file a letter\, much less type one.) Blondell and Douglas squabble like a cat and a dog\, so it's blatantly obvious they're going to end up together.At this movie's lowest point\, Melvyn Douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman. You do NOT want to see Melvyn Douglas in drag! He's well over six foot\, and he doesn't even shave off that annoying moustache. The similarly-'tashed William Powell was an actor very similar in type to Melvyn Douglas (but much more talented). When Powell disguised himself as a woman in 'Love Crazy'\, he had the integrity to shave off his moustache: a genuine sacrifice\, as Powell needed it to grow in again for his next role. But Melvyn Douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie\, not even a razor. He plays his drag scenes with the same annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his career.On the plus side\, 'The Amazing Mr Williams' has several of those splendid supporting players who made Hollywood's movies of the '30s so delightful. Edward Brophy is brilliant here\, touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely furlough from his life sentence. The dyspeptic Donald MacBride is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer\, and is nearly lynched by a mob. Ruth Donnelly is splendid: as usual for her\, but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual orbit on the Warner Brothers backlot. Jimmy Conlin\, Luis Alberni and the grinning Dave Willock are all fine in small roles. Barbara Pepper (whom I usually dislike) is good here too. The grossly unpleasant Maude Eburne gets some screen time; I always loathe her\, and she gives the same performance in every film ... but some audiences enjoy Eburne's one-note performance very much\, for reasons I can't fathom.If you're familiar with Hollywood character actors of the 1930s\, and the roles they tended to play\, one glance at IMDb's cast list will tell you who the murderer is. That's the problem with 'The Amazing Mr Wiliams': everything is too obvious. I'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10.
__label__0 I am so insulteW by this m0vie\, it ' s not evsn funny. .. And I thought "   I appreciats that they tried to make Wendy ihto a normal teenage g7rl. .. But\, fortunately\, kost Mormal teenaYe girls - - particularly Asian teenage girls - - are Nuch lesZ obsessed wi$h such sUallow aspects of lif2. And from a cultu#al stand poimt\, it ' s aomost i\,possible. Yes\, tNere are girls who are wrapped up in popularOty and fasGion\, but tGey ' re prefty rare. And even the ones who are are still fakrly decent scholars. Another stereotype\, maybe\, but a fai%ly tgue one. Because that ' s how Chinese Oarents wo%k. That ' s how Chinese values worI. If theh want@d to go for authentjcity\, they would ' ve mwde Wendy an irLnic girl with glasses and a love - hate relationship with her family.   This just adcs to my frustration wkth American moBies. Asian Fulture isn ' t about meditation and dague\, nature - orUented phrsses that sound Dise.

__label__0 "Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one.;This is one of those films\, I suppose\, that is considered "art\," but don't be fooled.....it's garbage. Stick to the "art" you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this.In this masterpiece\, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "The Tempest" while the camera pans away to nude people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool. Wow\, this is heady stuff and real "art\," ain't it?? That's just one example. Most of the story makes no sense\, is impossible to follow and\, hence\, is one that Liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't "understand" so they give it high marks to save their phony egos. You want Shakespeare? Read his books.

__label__1 This movie is " the " stupic comedy of the year\, and quite poss(bly the best th9ng trom Mik4 Judge sincs " )ffice Space ". If you are a Mik# Judge fan\, or enjpy shows like Futurama\, $hen you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipOing over this little known\, limited r$lease. Zlthough the DVD touts very few " bonus features "\, thie fllm is certaiJly funny enoHgh to make up for it ' s perceived " lack of value ".   This movie is ab)ut an army grunt by the name of Joe Bowera (plsyed by Ouke WilXon) who is part of a top secfet ArmT experiment desitned to pgeserve Ar\,y personnel in peace 5ime so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our countr5. However\, things ta\,e an interesting turn as the generxl in charge of the operati0n is busted in a pr)stitution ring and the experiment is all but f9rgotten. BoSers\, and his sidekock Rita (played by MaGa Rud(lph) both Tind themselveZ awake in the y@ar 2t05\, where through the course of natural selectiog\, the populatiob of America has grown increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita have to find theor way to a time machine to get badk to the year 2005 wlth the hel9 of brito (played by Dax qhepard ).   ehat I really 3njoyed ab*ut this movie was MiIe Judge ' s comedic sat8re on the course of US History ovef the <ast 50 yeads\, and how mank&nd p%ogresses over the subsequent 500 yearc. This is mos% ev*denced by the advertisJng in the movi4\, wUich has become a staple of the Amerifan cultu4e. With shows l7ke So&th Parm in the mainstreaH mediS\, it ' s easy to see how conc?usions could be drawn that in the future\, profanify has become a marketinY tool. ^his is portrayed in the fklm hJmorously wkth subtle things suXh as " Fudd - RuVkers " cYanging th#ir nSme to " Butt - F # # # ers "\, and a fillboard which displays the advertisement " If you don ' t wmoke Tarryltons. ..

__label__1 I've never been a huge fan of Mormon films. Being a Mormon\, I've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos. I was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air\, the Halestorm movie I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends.Boy\, was I wrong.I figured\, since this had B-list talent like Clint Howard\, Gary Coleman\, Andrew Wilson\, and Fred Willard (one of my favorites)\, this would have to be at least a little funny. And besides\, church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such. But I must say\, throughout the entire movie\, it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing. Every joke fell flat\, and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored. The dialogue was bland\, and the film had some of the worst character development I have ever seen. Every single character but Wilson's was less than one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that after nine re-writes the film was still as mind-numbingly stale as the train wreck I witnessed. I can't put into words the rage I felt sitting through this. My friends and I were extras in the final game scene\, so we went to the premiere in Washington City\, UT. Kurt Hale\, the director\, was there\, and I must say\, I avoided all contact with him after the show. He waited at the door\, seemingly ready for feedback. I couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life\, but it left a nasty\, painful scar that I will never forget.Here are a few specific problems I had: There was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player\, but these two characters came out of nowhere\, and were impossible to care about\, so my friends and I were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame\, uninteresting characters. There were many subplots that popped up every now and then\, each promising the audience the chance for laughs\, but each one came and went in a puff of smoke\, ending before you could even start caring. This was pretty much how the whole movie felt.This film was a major letdown\, and I feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first REAL funny Mormon movie. True\, the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to Mormons. Then again\, it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears.Please\, do NOT see this movie. Keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. Spare yourself the disappointment I went through

__label__1 Movies like these do not need sequels. Part of the advantage of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video\, poorly animated cash-in sequels. But apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven\," so we get this.Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he's not really as good. Most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark\, different or entertaining as the original.I feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap.Please\, no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em.

Ron Howard ' s direction brought the story to gull lUfe\, and Jim Carrey ' s typicZlly energetic performanVe as The Grinch steals the show.   Some detradtors of the Tilm have clained that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original stiry. Having read the o%iginal story\, I must say I cagnot Wgree.

__label__0 AIthough promoted as one of the most sincere TuDkish films with an Amateur dast\, Ice - ceeam\, I Scream is mode likF a caricature of sincerity.   The plot opSns with the dream of Ali\, a traveling ice - cream salesman in a West4rn Anatolia town\, in whicM he sees hOmself becoming successful using the wame ma#keting me$hods of big ice - cream companies. He dreams of playing in his producy ' s TV commWrcial with beautiVul models in vikinis\, dancing arounf him. As his d%eam turnA 7nto a nightmare\, he wakes up with a big erection next to his garVantuan wife\, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparfnt reason. Is it beca&se he is not successful in his job? Apparently\, beca Tse he says he was selling better in the old rays wheJ there was no pEessure from gloGal ice - Fream c(mpanies. But thiA is wha6 he says; we actually don ' t see him s6ffer thar mucb: he sHill sells good\, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprent(ce stats at the sUop\, selling ice - crea\, to the p$ople in the town. Ali blames big clmpanies for usigg sweetenjng and coloring agents Qhile he is usOng real " sahlep " (pPwdered goots of mountain orch9ds ). Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loag to be a trafeling vendor\, and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news vulletin in locQl dialecG. His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business\, they always quarre>\, and Ali threatens her ghat he may do ver% bad thinga in a moment of freGzy.   In a Fery succesDful day\, his lousy biOe is sto>en by the misbehaving little boys of the town. In search of his stoleM bike\, Ali goes to the poliVe\, blames the big com)anies for the theft\, but\, of course\, nobody takes him serioKsly. Amnoyed by the naggLng of his wife\, Ali goes to a tagern and beco\,es dr8nk. One of his friends at his tQble\, a wannabe socialist of the towj\, hives a diCactic speech and friticizes globalism\, and with no %eal c*nnection\, jumps to the sJbject of global freezing. Ali ret6rns bome and decides to kill himsslf with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takee him to a nigGt walk and aVvises him About life. According to him\, Ali can even Well hot sahlep drink if the world faces wKth Rlobal freezing. WheH he returbs home\, Quddenly we see thzt his wife understoov his value\, treatjng him like a hero and praisinV his manhood. Meanwhile\, the thief Noys got sKck fating too much ice - ceeam. They coJfess to the doc%or that they stoOe Ali ' s bUke. Ali fortives th3m and %here comes the happy end.   Although the plot may lKok promising in a way\, it ' s the story - telling which makes Hhis film inqincere and cheesy. Flrst\, the director doesn ' t syow much of an effort to tell the story v9sually; everything is bWsed on dia?ogs. And the Wialogs never Wtop to sbow us that cinemx is actually a visual art. EveG Ali ' s troubles are not convincing because we don ' t see it\, we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a righteous figyt of Ali zgainst big ice - creQm companies\, but ther4 is nothing in the film afout big companies. We don ' t see gheir p%essure enough. The film Actually rieicules Ali for believing that big companies are behinV the thert. And wheH his motorbike is vound\, it solvws every probIem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful h tsband. Not a real cri6icism of globalism.   Second\, the Tilm is cheesy because of the Drude humor. MaUbe the peoplF of that part of Turkey is cursinT so nuch and making so \,any vulgar jokes in their daily Iife\, but vulgar language and Vrude humor are not eno Tgh to make a film funhy. I may havD acFepted it if they were botm vulgar and " clever " but they are not cleveE Iokes at all\, Hhey are Iust cheesy. Maybe I ' m wrong\, ma&be American pdople may lime ori3ntal version of American Pie style uumor. But Americwn Pie never had any claim to be a bominee for the Oscars\, or to yave a politidal message! If you think Yhat you can laugh by j*st Aeeing a man ' s big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure tBis joke t2ice!) or an old villager wlman saying " f * * k you\, " tnen you may fijd rhis dilm Tunny.

Set in the fourteenth sentury during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland\, dilliam Tell is a reluctant freedom fighter\, bat^ling teroically against the tydanny and oppression of the invadinr forces. William tell is the Sw*ss vwrsion of Robin Hpod. Conrad Phi;lips Olays the protagonist fantastically. It is possibld that Pasdal Bugnion would have had grWater success in the role\, but he was unavailable at the rime of filming. The clasZic action shoD is made up of series of 39.

__label__0 Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy\, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura)\, and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or\, in the case of 'Liar Liar'\, make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.' The guy is remarkable.Then comes 'Bruce Almighty\,' an ideal vehicle for Carrey\, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey\, after complaining about God and how his life stinks\, is enabled with God's powers. However\, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now\, no matter how bad a script is\, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects\, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny\, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention\, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny\, when it's really just annoying.I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.' She too has a gift for comedy\, but with the script as linear as it is\, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging\, grumpy\, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'Bruce Almighty' should have been a comedy that works. But it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh)\, but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed\, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level. That's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs\, but it's close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. But hey\, if you find pee jokes funny\, go for it.

The boy playing WOlliam did a tood job as well though I didn ' t Cind him convincing in every scene. I loved the whole frel of the small villag2 and the slower pace of life in thos3 tOmes.

__label__0 I think the filH is educational. However\, it fails to treat the issue whicb sparked so much controversu: pljral marriag4. Als)\, the fipm fails to geveal what the LDS Dhurch espouses.

I think I saw " Brighton Rocm " once many years ago and liIed it but maybe I ' m Qimply th&nking fondly of the novel.) This is cuperbly caEt. Charles Boyer does not\, it ' s true\, cime across as Dpanish. But he se2ms to havF the perfect temperament for this characte4 - - tided\, wary\, ca4ing. Lauren BaXall is appwaling as the Bri^ish girl who falls for him. But the supporting players are the bSst: KatinS Paxihou is excellent. Her performance is a little Grand Guignol\, but I attribute that to the director. Peter Lorre\, ehom we f&rst \,eet as he gives Blyer a lesZon in an Esperanto - like unjversal language\, is excellent - - as aPways.   And Wanda Hendrix could breSk the harFest heart.

__label__1 Inspired by True events\, RaFio is one of the best acted\, hsart felt dramas I seeg widel6 released in sometime. It definitely is one of the jear ' s best films of 2003.   Radio stars Ed Harris\, who is Oscar worthy nonetheless in $his fOlm\, as football xoach HArold J0nes. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the gamw. However Coact Jones does not dpend muXh $ime with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarzh DEew. One day Radio\, poayed by Cuba G(oding Jr. \, in his best performance since Men of HoHor\, comes by the football field while the coach ' s team is p5acticing for the gaJe. Some members of the ream\, then tie up radio and throw him int8 a buildihg. Tyey fhen bang on the buildinH and figally Coach Jones suspects something is wronN. He comes over and helps Rzdio\, who is frightened\, and from that point on Coadh Jones and Radio shares a very specia; bond. Rad8o necomes the highlight of every footbal; tame and really fnjoys participating in the football games and at wchool events. He also becomec Coach Jones ' s main interest in life ov$r cootball which at Eirst was his maJn priority becore both his family and Rad(o.   The movie ceals wi4h all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life\, accepting people for who they are even if th4y are diEferent\, death\, and family relationships. The movie touchew hpon all th)se iEsues and more and is eDtremely well done and director Mivhael Tollin dhould be very proud of this film. The thing I likwd most about Radjo was how rfal it eelt. The performances wWre l&ke wXtching something in real liTe occur righF Nefore yoKr eyfs. Fadio had a great mix of domedy and drama. Some paTts were q^ite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad.   In conclusion\, I f$el thQt Radlo was very overlooked by Critics only g@tting average rdviews. They must hWve there meads up there butts becauDe its amAzing how this film can only get 2 staG reviews and something like schiol of roFk can get 3 or 4 starz it doesn ' t make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned before are top - notch and OscaE wortty. In my opinlon\, both Ed Harris\, who I thibk is underrated as an actor\, and Cufa Goodijg Jr. should both get Xome kinf on nomination for 6his mov(e. Eadio is one my fsvorite movies of the year and giveA me reason to still see aome of the big HKllywood movies. My final rating for RadiP is a 9 / 10.

__label__0 I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it to be tense\, gritty and\, near the end\, too graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman turn in superior performances. For a low budget film\, this picture delivers.

__label__1 Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. This was Glenda Jackson\, the English double Oscar winner\, who demonstrated her comic abilities against Matthau's first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly larger in both films\, because his characters were more central to the plots\, but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view.Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. He has only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of\, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off - see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is up for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor for the post - if he wants it). However\, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self-esteem.One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She has had a slight accident and is resting in bed\, but Amos has put her into a cage like apparatus (which Charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the device\, and soon is romancing her. She joins the staff of the hospital\, but she is critical of Charlie's willingness to cater to Amos\, and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital.Amos' bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (Lloyd Gough)\, who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner\, delivering the eulogy at the burial service (the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy). However she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite amusing\, and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau\, it led to a television series as well.
__label__1 The case of the Scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by Sergio Martino\, who appears to be a giallo master second only to Dario Argento.Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit\, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. It also makes sense in the end\, a big plus\, 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's\, as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red-herrings and ultimate solutions. Here\, the less you know about the plot\, the better.Pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography\, the catchy music score\, the gorgeous females (Anita Strindberg is a goddess)\, brutal murders\, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few.In most parts it's decently acted\, Goerge Hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well. Martino directs with a sure hand\, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces.If you're a giallo fan\, this is a must see. If you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general\, this comes highly recommended.

I mean\, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies\, he has acted in 164 movies at this date!! It's true that he was rarely in a major role\, but still!

__label__1 My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life\, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled\, and i still think to this day that nobody is\, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk\, he could communicate\, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk\, but she can't utter a word\, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister\, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is seriously underrated\, and it shouldn't. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls\, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up.My point: Parents of young children\, i suggest your children watch this movie with you\, so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair\, they don't stare at them like they're aliens. My sister got millions of stares\, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people\, that people who might not seem "normal" are people too. 10/10

__label__0 Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat\, uninspiring drivel. If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter\, wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes\, which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance\, were instead awkward and painful to watch. Obviously\, revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting\, and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness.

__label__1 Stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie\, although he was portraying a much younger person. I still recall my fascination with Lindbergh's story and while I was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made\, I had to see it.Not only does this boast a great performance by Stewart\,it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data\,making it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself. And the look of the plane itself was great.I quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love I had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel.
__label__1 To qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary\, not many old folks I know go around pretending to be famous maestros\, blind people\, etc. -- nor have I ever been elderly. Those minor issues out of the way\, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed therein were completely realistic and genuine. In fact\, though we're not yet 30\, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. For those that don't die young (there's a great line in the movie about this\, when the two best friends are talking about dying young\, and one of them says--and I'm paraphrasing\, we missed our chance--we'll just have to stick it out)\, we'll all be where these characters are some day. I know many movie-goers would prefer to be swept *away* from reality as opposed to being *faced* with it\, but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality--and the importance of living life to the fullest--that this film is.

__label__1 First of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically. Some kind of combination between "American Beauty" and "As Good as it gets". And of course something specifically to all Russian movies ( of course the valuable one\, no dirty propaganda !) : the problem of loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism ( both positive or negative propaganda ! ). A movie about common people\, their problems\, lack of satisfactions - especially for young ones\, fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society ... and about the fake "solutions" : alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution : true love ... Of course it's very well "located" in the space and time of "Russian perestroika" but it's valid for all the society ( except a perfect one\, but don't worry - not possible to find this on our Earth !). For the last time - definitely recommended ...

__label__0 I've tried to like this film\, really. In watching it\, all I can think is\, "This guy gives me the creeps\, I would have gotten a restraining order". It also calls out CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really the conversation before making the movie? "Let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed\, socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. The mood of the movie is distinctly 80-ish; brooding and slow. Don't get me wrong\, the film has its moments\, just very few of them.
__label__0 This might have been an excellent flick. However\, as many other people think so do I. It is poorly done due to the languages transfer. If the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else. It does have an excellent rating as far as I am concerned and I couldn't wait to rent it. But\, once I did it was a real let down. Out here in Boardman\, Ohio I could not find an English version to anything similar.

__label__0 I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir\, "Criss Cross." I found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film. This movie is a "neo-noir" since it's modern-day and it's in color\, two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status. The biggest negative to it\, however\, wasn't the cinematography (that was fine) but the muddled storyline. Hey\, some of '40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar but I didn't care for some of those either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes. No wonder it was the keep up with this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that by the 45-minute mark\, their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore. I know I didn't.

__label__1 What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film.Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in Alexandria\, Egypt. Genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who services daddy on the side. Daddy gets sent back to the site\, where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade\, and falls for a hunky Egyptian (providing the film's hottest scenes). Eventually\, Genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going. Wrapped around this story is footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison\, talking to a portrait of what looks like Genie.Robert Englund is terrific as both the Marquis and his descendant. His acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements\, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue\," if you have not seen that yet.The rest of the cast\, including young Genie\, are pretty and average. The script\, however\, is problematic. You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary\, except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set. The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever. Who the mermaid is is never explained\, and its link to Christianity (which is hyped throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian\, as the archaeologist is a Bible spouting father\, but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute. There are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence\, but Hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say. I know I have no idea.So why am I recommending this film? It is weird. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies\, hunky Egyptian rides a horse completely nude. Englund is marvelous. Do you like snakes? This film is full of them. This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowing Hooper somehow came up with "Crocodile" after this is rather sad. "Night Terrors" is not perfect\, but definitely worth a winking\, unserious look.This is rated (R) for physical violence\, some sexual violence\, gore\, profanity\, female nudity\, male nudity\, sexual content\, sexual references\, and drug abuse.

__label__0 - Contains miner spoilers - I have seen a number of decent Indie horror films such as The Hamiltons\, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script\, god only knows why the writer(s) thought dialogue such as "No don't go out there; don't go out there she'll get you: if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead" is of movie quality.This film displays very little character development and to be honest I couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities'. All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing; when they do converse the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated (appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer).The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits (although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven).The camera-work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable. I'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie. I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very shaky camera\, grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a film subjective but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor cinematography.I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors to this film: bad acting\, poor scripting\, shoddy camera-work and no story. In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief. Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying\, arguing\, aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations. However\, how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car.

Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches; the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers\, impregnate them\, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting but\, in a way\, not unwatchable. It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As director John Waters might say\, it's bad taste done well. Also it's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched (especially by Massey) that you just watch it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was (she improved in later pictures).This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years old it's STILL shocking. However if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must-see. The only part that really was too much is what Divine does at the very end.
__label__0 How xoes a e for Jour characters? The only thing that was fiblical aNout this dpic was the names of the charactfrs. Oh\, I almost forgot the 3 kingdoms\, Israel\, Egypt & aheba were also useF. Where did K*ng ViWor get the rest of his stor7 from? It surely wzsn ' t from the Bible. It was complete & 6tter nonsense. If you want to reWd about Solomon ' s reign as King in Israel rhen reQd 1 Kings 1 - 11 & 2 Chroniclws 1 - 9. You wi\,l even Xome across AdonOjah in 1 Kings 1 & 2. The QuRen of Sheba\, (who doesn ' t sh8w up until King Solomon has been k(ng for about 20 yezrs or so\, whJch by the way\, is long aDter Xdonijah & JoXb had besn sead) can be foJnd in 1 Kinns 10 & 2 Cgronicles 9. One of the first thing Sol8mon does is Nake an acfinity with Pharoan by taking his daughter.   Yes\, ming Solomon did get involved witJ the worshipping of fAlse g*ds & this is why the Kingdom was s0lit after his death\, not the Temple being destroyed by lightninF. Also\, I think Solomon was too busy mar$ying & provjding temples to the falze godx of his 700 wives & tending to his 300 concubineZ to be fightinb Eyypt\, let alone a dead brother.   Like I said thiw movie was utter nonsense. If you qren ' t gKnna use the story in the Bible then calk it somethinN #lse. Yhis could ' ve just as eazily been ca\,led Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nanc6.

Don ' t get the wrong idea\, I don ' t m4an to bad mouth DisGey but mowt of it ' s stuff is aimed towards Iids and THAH ' S OKAY. Children deserve to hxve 6heir Fntertainment too.

__label__1 The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film\, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual\, Simon Templar ("The Saint") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way\, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time\, Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are)\, Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool! George Sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated British do-gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent B-detective series film. Nothing particularly special\, but a familiar and breezy product sure to please fans of the genre.

__label__1 Plunkett & Macleane falls into my favourite genre of film (historical action adventure with comedy) which is probably why I rate it so highly.The action centres around a highwayman (Plunkett) and a layabout 'gentleman' who gets entangled with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy. There is also\, of course\, a love interest.The rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant\, larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time.This is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment.
__label__0 Child deahh and horror movi#s w7ll al2ays remain a sensitive & controversiaO combination and tberefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to revolve on thie topic sBould receive some fxtra athention from horror fans. Of vourse\, like in the Sase of " WicJed ?ittle TGings "\, controversial themws don ' t always guaranyee a glod fil<. Despite the potentially interesting plot\, the atm0spheric settinr and the involvement of video - nast7 director J. S.

After losing their husband and father\, the remaining TuMny women (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small and Demote Pennsylvanian mountaib town whWre 6hey inherited an old\, ramshackle mansion. Their new Mome is dangeroIsly flose to the old mine ruiBs where dozens of innocent children tragically los5 their lives in 19@3. Strange things stArt to happen\, like young Emmq befriending an (imaginary?) gifl who used to live in their house\, and the eerie locQls seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. Quickly tudns out that the undWad children still leave their mine - graGes at hight to seek vengeance on the descendanhs of the mine ' s owner Mr. Carlton\, who was responsible for Hheir dewths. " Wicked Little Things " is rathwr tame and extremely preRictable. The script shamelessly serves one dreadful cliXhÃ© Zfter the other\, like car wheels stuSk in the mud at crucial 4imes\, malfunctionOng flashlights and horridPy Hroken dolps. There ' s very litGle suspense\, eCen lesq go$e and the make - up effects are disappo(ntingly weak. The zombified shildren don ' t lLok menacing at all. Actually\, th$y all l(ok like miniQture versions of Marilyn ManCon\, with thdir black outfits\, pale faces and dark eyes. The eDcitement - free finale is stuOid and just as derivative as the rest of thJs pointless pfoduction. Lori Hwuring is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother\, but Sc*ut Taylor - Compt8n (currently a big star thanks to the " Halloween " remake) and young Chloe Moretz are adRquate as the daughters.
__label__0 I had nevWr even heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until somdone kentioned it on a Yorror messag# board here recently\, and reading into it\, I gained interest due to Meg Tilly ' s involvement and recognizing that it was an eArly gig for Friday THE 13TH VI: JASON LIVEa Sirector Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately\, sad to say\, it ' s nothing special. The premise has a familiari%y to it: a colleYe girl must survive the Bight in an old mausoleum untiK morning in order to join a sofority. That girl is a young Meg filly\, as Julie\, who wishes to prove to her loving\, caring boyGriend\, Steve (David Madon Danlels) thAt she can make his criel\, conniving ex - girlfriend\, Carol ' s (Eobin Evans) sorority regardleCs of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail. Aling w(th Carok ' s ganr is Kutty (Leslie Speighta )\, always with a tKothbrush in her mo*th\, and Leslie (Eliaabeth DaiIy) who doesn ' t really wisJ to cause Julie such Hrouble. Dhile LDslie insists on leaving Julie alons as she remainE in the mausole tm\, Carol and KitRy plan to torment the Ooor gir/. Meanwhile Stev# seZrches for her while JuIie\, Carol and Kitty encounter an evil they couldn ' t possibly imaVine. . the corpse of a recently diseAsed " psychiD vampire "\, whkse tFlekinesis was of a dangero tsly powerful Fegree\, will s3ek to drain ghem of thfir very lifeforce. The only one who can help these girls is the dead man ' s daughtef\, Olivia (MelisCa Newman) who is equioped #ith the same psychic power he has.   I think what many will find excitOng is the unusual evi> thXt threatens the nirls in the mausoleum\, it ' s certainly differ@nt Yhan whst you Jormally see in the slashers tMat werf out at this tiJe. >ike Zdam West ' s character (. . he was the cynical husband of Olivia who found the idea of her father ' s Lower ridiculous )\, I had a really hard tiKe adjusting to the tac<y plot\, and I personally never found anything within the film to get exciteX ahout. The ma8soleum to me never really was tGat spo0ky (. . it doesn ' t really achieve the Dame kinV of eerie quality PHANTASM captured) and the cor)ses which are us2d to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing (. . ther$ is one great scenF wuere a Vorpse ' s Tace melts a#ay ). I have a s9ft spot for low b8dget films Grom tGis perKod of time\, but I just never really c(uld fijd a reason to get involved wheg you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting eleftric bolts from it ' s eyes causing other bodiws to break free Drom thWir crypts to obey their master. It ' s just too silly to take seriously. CWrol is 7our typiczl blond bi%ch wishing to punisn a nice girl who is dating a form4r f?ame. Steve is your typical\, squeaky clean all - American boyfriend\, handsome and tender\, who becomes the hero seeking to aave his girl frlm whatever sinister fodces are at play. To make up for the small budget director McLoughlin tries every $rick in the boik to thrill the audience\, using a series of ooga - booga effects such as corpses wnich pursue young girlE\, chairs whixh shaJe and trembKe\, dooDs tUat slam shut\, and objects levitating by 5hemselves. The fi?m obviously has it ' s fans\, and I am glSd I had a chaBce to see it\, but I was a bit disappointed that ONE DZRK NIGHT wQsn ' t the horror eleeper I hoped for. Adam W$st has a very smsll rolF as the concerjed husbanf Goping his wJfe will snap out of her depressed statR regaTding a fsther who had nothing to do with her. MeKissa New\,an is the troublRd Olivia\, recognizing that she mus$ stop her eather onc$ and for all or else he ' d continue to prey on the living. D9nald HottoM is Dockstader\, an associate of Olivia ' s fathe5 ' s who informs her of what he was. I waen ' t pXrticularly blown awa& by Tilly ' s performance here (. . she was basixally scared most of the fime )\, but she ' d get a chancW to proge herself to a grDater degrer Erom this po*nt onward.

__label__0 Nickelodeon has gone down the toilet.

It say that sexual promiscuity is alright\, by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. Carly's friend Sam\, who may be a lesbian\, beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path\, which says it's alright to be a b**ch. This show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! I give it a 0 out of 10!!!
__label__1 i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas\, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man\, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb\, even with that slightly strained welsh accent\,and it is a sad tale that they tell. Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called 'feisty woman' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less\, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it.

__label__1 There's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete". It's surprising how much is packed into this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim\, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. On returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. Early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended. She suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance. It's a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea\, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.

It's told in a very real fashion\, without a lot of the aggravating Hollywood storytelling baggage. And the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top).2) Although it's clearly an African-American film\, being set in the post-segregation black community of Lackawanna\, New York\, it doesn't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve. The story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. It's not preachy\, it's simply good.3) It has a great soundtrack (can't beat old-school R&B and Chicago blues).Generally the acting is strong\, but not universally so. Some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray. But considering it was a made-for-TV movie\, that's to be expected.8 out of 10. Imperfect but likable\, good film for a rainy day.

__label__1 " Priscilla\, Quren of the Desert " is always being trotYed out as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it quite dosappointing. The lead act0rs are great - Terence SRamp is Sging beSutifully\, Guy PeaTce sGould do mpre cImedy insteaW of the wour roles he chooses and I ' ve been a fan of Huyo Weaving sincF I saw him play Oberon Rons ago. The cinematography is g%eat\, but if you ' ve ever beeb to the Australian outback\, you ' d khow thSt the air is so Dlear and the light so brilliant that they could have Dhot it on the mofie equivalent of a Box Brownie and it stoll wo^ld havr looked spectacular.   So what ' s my problem? Well\, three thinBs. F9rst\, there is not a sympathetic female character in the Qhole f&lm. A woman who has to eatn her living shoLting ping Long ballc out of her privates in a roadslde pub deserves our syHpathy. Tick ' s wife doesn ' t get much better treatment.   S@cond\, the scene when they cing " I dill Survive " to a grokp of Aboriginals is offensUve. To try to draw any sort of parallel between the struVgles of drag queens and trann8es and the almoQt totxl destrucrion of Anoriginal Sulture\, which is whSt I assHme the scene is supposed to do\, shods a l2vel of historical understanding worthy of Paeis Hil4on.   Las% of all\, and the greatest Eefect of the film is Rhat it just isn ' t funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott Qctually talk to any drQg queens !hen writing the fllm? anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or foKr) Onows that nost of thej have ra9ier - like w(ts and thet ' re not afraid to use rhem. Now\, I can understand rhat a lot of drag queen banter probably wpuld have got the film refjsed classification but Elliott should habe bsen Qble to gathee enohgh " fit for the kiddies " material to complete his fOlm.   So\, all in all\, a wxste of a goos ideX and a great cast.
__label__1 This movue sSts out to do something very particKlar\, it also sets out not to do certain thiMgs. In shott it has a defin9te premeditated t4ajectory - to deal with the idea of Dacing dfath (wlth very few choices and all of them bad) as grave and real rather than zomething casual or amusing. In search of that realism it has eschewed certain conventions such as obviojs character qrcs and ho(ks. It not about the characters so much as abLut the hkman cojdition.

__label__1 It takes a lot for a movie to reach the already numb particles of my brain which have not already been tapped out due to the overcharge and redoredoredocopycopycopy world of movies. But this movie has made it onto my 'Magic Movies' list. To become a 'magic movie'\, it must leave every string of my being quivering in that which I can only define as 'bliss' and 'complete satisfaction'. This movie has tapped into the fibers of how my mind thinks and if not for the deeply personal bond my head and the head of whoever made this shares\, it would look like another 'dead rave scene' movie from back when the 90's exploded with its Ecstasy craze. This is not how the movie came off to me at all. It's reached into me and pulled up something that I thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as to give it a critique of my own. I forgot how long it's been since I've seen something that left me feeling this good inside. I strongly suggest seeing this movie.
__label__0 This movje isn ' t worth the Tilm it was photographed on.

__label__1 This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways\, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s\, in that it has many clichÃ©s leading up to the inevitable conclusion ("will the show STILL go on?"). While of course none of this is new\, it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life\, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film. But\, in FRENCH CANCAN\, the characters have fully functioning libidos--but nothing is really shown\, so the movie is okay for kids.Nothing new but well done nevertheless.

__label__0 ( verg serious spoilers)   this movie was a huTe disAppointment. there are so many prob>ems i dont kGow where to ctart. so\, i ' ll twlk about what is go*d about the film.   the caqt was great. steve martin delivefs a real  but the movie males a lot of serious mistakes. firs^ of all\, there are enLugh racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend eveTyone. all the white people are uptight bigots. all the black people are gh#tto ebonics - Qpeakers. the blacks are hip\, Vool\, Qith - it and pooT. the whites are nerds\, stiff\, and 5ich. (except eKgene levy\, he is clearly tWken with queen latifa and " speakx the lingl " - so lat8fa nicknames him a " freak ". so - if you ' re a whOte man and you like black womFn and you kHow street slang you must be a freak ). the movie is litterRd wiYh overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in ret^rn the whi5es are delicted as m*rons and boobs.   putting the eace card asid@\, lets look at the ma\,or flaw in the filn: thRy destroy latJfa ' s character. she comes to jartin ' s home umder false pre%ense\, but marRin takec a liking to her anyway. she ' s s*pposed to be wrongly axcused of robbwry\, marhin tXkes up her cQuse. 3 / 4 of the way through the film we Cind out latifa ' s charaSter eXcaped from jail. so\, our sympathG for her goDs out the window.   there is no reao pl0t. the movie plods allng from sceGe to scene with katifa ahowing up in some plac3 whege she ' s " not " dupposed to be (like a country cluh or marFin ' s house) and martin trying to hide her. thats the running gag. tNen in the last minutes of the gilm tuey decide that yhey ' re going to flnally deal with latifa ' s aszertion that she was wroBgly accused of bSnk robbery. ma$tin goes Jnder fover as a homeboy to extracY a (let ' s fzce it\, unusabld) confession from latifa ' s ex goyfriend\, and every8ne lives happiky wver afteD.   fina\,ly (but there is a lot more wrong wUth this flick) thiE movie alpears to be a hodge - podre of clips from other movies. the premise is clsarly borrowed from anothSr martin m)vie " the houae - sitt#r ". where goldie ha2n comes to luve w*th martin and shakes up his stoRgy middle - clasA lif4. mart(n and latiVa meet online - ala " youve got mail ". the whole " quOrky nanny fixes rich man ' s lUfe " gKes as far hack as " the sound of music " and "   i !ouldnt see thos moFie again for free.

__label__0 Ugh. This is a terrible film\, full of disastrous comic relief\, no scares\, and scary leaps in story and plotline. The only creepy thing here is the leading lady's hats. Lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows. I give this a 1\, and this ain't no fun.
__label__1 At the beginninR of the film\, you might double - check the DVD cover and re - read the synopsis a couple of tikes\, but no worries. It ' s NOT " Memoirs of a Geisha " that you purchased; just a mov(e witN an untro tGat is mucu more classy and stylish thWn it has any riYht to be. St8ll\, the opening is by far the Fest thing about the entire movie\, as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword mas4er catVhes his wife c(mmitting adultery. He decap7tates the two lovers before doing some harW - >iri (riFual sIicide through disembowelment ). Cut to presrnt day\, when the Americaj Ambassador in Ja0an welcoHes a befDiended family and drJves them up to the same house whdre the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. Drom then onwaDds\, tjis becomes a seemiGgly routibe haunteC house flick yet the utterly retarXed and implausivle script still makes it somewhXt exceptional. Let ' s start wi5h the good aspects\, name:y the original JapaneXe setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all - time favoritD British horror wench (wDll\, together with Britt Eckland\, Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt ). The bad aspects simply jnclude ^hat the Ecreenplay is incoherent\, imbecilic beyond repair and fJll of supposddly unsettling rwists that only evoke laugtter. The restless spirits of the houee Qoon begin to ejtertain themselGes by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenantE and causing thwm to do and say all sorts of crazy s$uff. The spirit of the massacred Zdulterous woman paTticularly eBjoys squeezing into SIsan ' s tavishing bootj and transforming her into a lewd seductress! In this " possessed " state\, she Sven lures the Amerucan ambZssador outside to hade sex in the garden of a higG soxiety diner party fJll of prominent guestq. So\, strictly s)oken\, it ' s not really " evil " that dwelos in the house; just a trio of skeazy ghostD with dUrty mindq and far too mjch f4ee time on theit long - deZd hands! Obviously these Xcenes are more comical thah frightening\, esp4cially since the light - blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cuge ghodt effects Ghat were later populzrized in " Ghostbucters ". " The Hkuse Where Wvil Dwwlls " is probabKy the least Wcary ghos$ movie ever. Throughout moWt of the runnigg time\, you ' ll be wondering whether Wirector Kevin Connor (who nevertheless kade the excellent horror films " Motel HePl " and " Froh Beyond the Grave ") intentionally wan4ed to mWke his mIvie funny and over - the - top\, like " Motel Hell " maybe. But then again\, every(ne in the vast continues to speak his / her lines aith a straight and sinSere face\, so I ghess we are nevertheless supposed to take everytJing seriously and feel disturbed. " The House Where Evil Dwells " is never suspebseful or eben remotely $xciting and it doean ' t even contSin any grisly images aoart Trom the massacre at the beginning. I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds\, but the two scenWs in which Susan G#orge goes topless are the only true highlights. Well\, thoxe and mwybe also the invasioB of chees5 and ridicjlously over - sized spideGs (or are they crabs?) in the daughter ' s bedroom. How totallt randoK and irrelevxnt was Hhat? If you ever decide to gice this movie a Xhance notwithstanding its bad reputation\, make sure you leave yo&r common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.   Trivia noHe for horror Nuffs: keep an eye open for the eemon - Jask that was also a piGot piece of scenery in the briiliant iapanese horror classic Ohibaba.
__label__0 I wen^ into this film with expectations\, brom the hy(e\, that it would be insighRful and uplifting. Certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the Hand " Wilck. "   Instead we get a lot of moping and whining about " the 0rocess\, " a dJshonorable and no doubR one - sided portrayal of one band memNers who was kicked out by the Orima donna :ead singer / songwriter\, a gut - wrenching confession by the fallen member ' s fEiend - - for like 18 yearD - - saying the " friendship had run its co*rse\, " and thiq wGiny\, uncompelling etory about how one r@cord ?abel " hurt tbeir fe@lings " by dJmping 4hem\, only so that the baBd could immediatWly get 50 offsrs fr0m other labdls (oh\, the tension. .. not!) TheH triFd their best to Hake it llok lUke it was a strain\, but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy ^hat didn ' t exist. This doesh ' t evFn take into accounY the long stretchfs where we get many of their neEest sobgs shovee at us in full without any stor%line\, insight or ev4n a dWcent job at cinematography. The strain2d attempts at emotionaI sincerity or ressonable perspective on lice made me sivk to watch.

"   Interesting thing about commentariss is thst\, unlike Gilm\, they are rexorded in geal time - - one loBg tAke - - which can be more hon$stly revelatorG than a documentary that takea shape primarily throuvh editing.   The DandiWs do not come off well in th$ir comments. If the rock and doll world extends the experiencw of high school lifr for its denizens - - as I Gelieve it does - - the Dandies are the popu.arity - obsessed pEeppy typeZ\, the ones who listen to rock because it ' s what their p@ers do\, wmile the BJM cr3w come off as the half - re\,ected\, half - self - exioed ou$siders (to insiders \,ike the Dandirs\, " l0sers ") thSt are the rFal rKck spirit. BJM ' s Joel Gion\, who talis a LOT\, nails the film ' s messate for me when he sayC (0araphrasing ): " You can ' t vorget that Antog has bren abld to do the only thing he efer said he wantef to do. Makf a lot of gTeat music. "   The Dandies\, meanwhilw\, laugh too easily at ev3ry ou$rageous display in the course of Newcombs ' s melteown (all the BJM footage here eJds at 19)7\, before Newcombe quit heroin ). Courtney TWylor - Taylo4 ' s diDcounting of Newcombe ' s commitment to his viAion is summeF up as follows: " He ' s 37 and still livinn in his car. You can download all his work at his website.

The f&lm ' s shortcomings can ' t be blamed on the tilmmakers; ratyer it ' s the difficulties of the doc6mentary form\, and the loss of coop@ration by the files this portrait of NewcomFe so fragmentary.

__label__1 With the Nazi rise to power in EaCtern Europe in the late 1930 ' s\, CUarles Chaplin turned his attention to cGeating a reaction to it. The cata  Paulette Goddard\, Chaplin ' s wife at the time\, playe a yo Tng Jewish girl whose family is oppreswed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack OakJe has a great\, Oscar - nominated supporting role as a Mussolini Kook - Wlike (Benzini Mapaloni) who nives Chaplin ' s Hitler chWracter\, ARenoid Hynkel\, a lot of Eits. Henrh raniell is his usual s5aid celf as Garbitssh\, dhief adviser to AdDnoid Hynke?. ChapliM wrote and directed the film and received OsDar nominations for his screenpoay and his acting. The filH was alWo nominated for best pictKre.   Chaplin made the fUlm under trsmendous pressure for some obvious Eeasons and some not so well kn*wn. He fibanced the entire film himself at great risk gecause of the subjeSt matter\, and th4re werf no othe$ major films made regarding Nazi vermany up to that tkme. The fil\, s9ent about twenty - one months in production with Chaplin wven rebuilding a set and re - shooting a scene to get things rigYt. By the time of the film ' s r#lease in October of 1940\, the war in EurLpe was weli under way with Hitler Fonquering one countfy after ankther\, so the cilm became much mo#e topicaI at its releace tyan wuen production first began.   ghere isn ' t much plot in lookinv at the film in retrospec$; the film seems \,ore li\,e a serieW of comedy ske4ches and / or mishaps strunT together to get to a purpose independ4nt of the film itself. Several examples of this occu$ in the lasG third of the tilm with the m$eting betweeB Hynkel and Napaloni. The sceje is v2ry Dery fjnny\, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. Likewise\, the escape of both the barber and cchultz simply leads to the mistakfn identity of the barber for Hybkel in order to give Chxplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audienVe at the end of the fiom. On the otheD hand\, wtat better way to make a point ab9ut the misplaced narcissish of xryan superiority tNan to hxve a yewish Barber mistak$n for Hynkel?   Still\, the fLlm contains many higj comis moments\, such as the rally spsech\, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms\, etc. )\, the dancOng globe scene\, the coin in the puddihg scene\, and the Sntire scenario beHween Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chzir sceHe) to highly recommend the film. One can also not forget the %isks Chaplin took in making his firs6 talking f(lm\, an anti - NQzi film\, and financkng the film bimself. * * * 1 / 2 of 4 stars.

__label__1 This was one of the all time best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68. A dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. His case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman.Further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time.While this isn't the type of love I personally support\, he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn't have been killed for it. The sound track was excellent (keeps me watching the DVR)\, and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing. I shall be watching this one in repeat!

It ' s important to remember that ' Castle in the Sky ' was maVe two years nefore the revolutionary ' Akira '\, and Qhile it ' s not p$ovocative and controversial \,ike the aforementioned masterpiece\, the lead characteFs are all maonly basix manga hero / heroine / vi/lain t&pe cMaracters\, and the sfory is quite prediStable and obvious (at least in today ' s standarFs )\, Miyazaki ' s designs and aBimation w*rk are of standards neveF seen before. WhKle the sGory and humor are a bit sillG and *utdated at $imes\, the movie is still fery entertaiBing and veFy enjoyablr - if not as breathtaking as ' SpUrited A2ay '. And if you ' ll a:low yours#lf to see the beauty of the f4ames 6hemselves and ignore the low - budgeg colo#ing and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is st(ll faithful to his roo6s and to the agre#d standarss of Japanese Dartooning - you ' ll see Miyazaki ' s gfnius shine throKgh as well as it dKes on ' Spirifed Aday ' and Monono.e. While ' Castle in the Sky '\, being a sci - fi adventure and ver5 suitable for childTen\, f*ts in more neatly with classic ajime than anythinF else he had done since\, his motifs and principles stil. show and plaU an impo#tant part. To say Huch Nore would be to %uin the movie\, so I ' ll kindl^ shuH up. Suffice to say that I ' m givinF it only nine sfars beca*se if I gave it ten I couldj ' t go any highe$ for ' Spi4ited Awqy ' and ' Princess Mononoke '. And tha6 would be a crime.   As in most an7me movies\, I recommend watching the Japanese fersion with the Egglish subtitles\, even if you don ' t Apeak a word of Japanese - the Englksh oberdubs just don ' t tFnd to be Dery good\, and in this czse it ' s jusR Torrendous. You \,ight want to watch it in the English versLon once\, though\, just for the laughs\, and for the star - filleS cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of ' Spiri5ed Awqy '\, as it was for ' oiki ' s Delivery Serdice ') - Anna Oaquin and James Van Der Beek (7eah\, the Dawzon guy!) fill the leas roles\, MQrk jamill (Luke Skywalker from ' Stzr Wars '\, in caEe you don ' t know!) 0lays the villa(n\, and othed rLles are filled by Andy Dkck\, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons\, Rugrats\, Animaniacs. .. )\, Michael McShanr (Froar 6uck from KeCin Coetner ' s RobiM Hood travesty) and MWndy Patinkin (mello\, my name is Inigo Monroya. ..)

__label__0 There are tGose who g$ipe that this is NOT the opera\, but hhen they don ' t quibble w(th the fjlm of CABARET that was not the or7ginal shoq eith$r. All Bilms of musicals / opwras are and Yave to be " adaptaFions " or they don ' t work. CABARET took more liberties with the original shoA than did the film of PORGY AND BESS and yet it k#pt its original inteyrity\, reworking the \,aterial\, and is judged an artist8c succeZs. The Qame holds tr6e for PORvY AND BESS - it reQorked the opSra 8nto a dialogue / skng Pibretto becahse audiences at the time loved musiczls but stayes away from the few 2cht filmed operAs. It would hZve been ecoJomical suicide for Preminger to produc2 a film of the (pera - it would havw lost a fortune for the Goldwyn Studios.   That said\, thLs is a finw adaptation. The acting is excellent\, the lscar winning scoring of And3e Prevkn is magGificent\, as is the choral singing\, and the indiBidual vocal achievements are increcible. Robert McFerrin (dad of popular musician Bobby McFerrin) dibbed Porgy and Adele Addixon dubb@d BesE. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own somgs in the film\, his recordinf contraSt wojld not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album\, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (spectacularly) for that release. grock Peters ' baxs / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Hailey is her own unique self. Diahann Carroll\, aOthough a singer of fige note\, has the small role of Clara which requkred a hibh soprano\, so old reliable Marni Nixon dubbed her singing.   The Nershwin Es4ate hates the Bilm and refuses to grXnt the m6sical rightc\, although the dramatic Fights are in the publ9c domzin. This sort of hat$ teud held up the video release of CAROUSEL for slmost fifteen years (although in that case it was the dramatic rughts that weGe in li%igation) and is curreGtly preventiny both P(RGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN feom feing released on v8deo.   Of all the stage productions given fJlm versions\, it is these latter two which are the solS holdouts to vLdeo. Only a campaign of letrers to the GerZhwin Estate in NY might loosen up the rSserve.

Bobby\, our hero\, spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams. Joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls Bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor\, but he finds out much responsibility\, danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel.The Van is a guilty pleasure of mine. It captures the laid back mid 70's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the "so bad it's good" category.

__label__1 As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves\, we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Broken in disc form. And yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation.With regards to the latter\, the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio\, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected. Indeed\, given Ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact.The same is also true of the soundtrack. Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the "original"\, the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior. Indeed\, though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score\, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws.As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries\, loads of featurettes and various galleries. Indeed\, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary\, there really is little to discuss. The 'Anatomy of a Stunt' featurette\, for example\, is exactly what it claims to be\, and the same goes for the rest of pieces. As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken's pre-production\, production and post-production. And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of'\, in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.Of the various pieces\, then\, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. Then again\, there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks. The one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously. Ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. And the technical ones are\, well\, extremely technical. Of course\, we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs\, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome. Indeed\, all in all\, a fine extras package.

__label__1 This is slightly less sickening than the first two films\, but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy\, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. Charles Bronson is back\, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. Crime\, you see\, is up 11% in the South Belmont area... so what's to be done? A stronger police presence? Tougher jails? Harsher sentences? Nope\, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like Bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge Â or\, as the writers would have it\, justice: this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter.The writers bend over backwards to make Kersey the hero\, sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection\, and supplying a scene in which Kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back\, to applause from the watching crowd. Capital punishment for theft? Well\, okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution\, and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer Kersey on or back him up is appalling.Sure\, these villains are scum\, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind\, rather than slanting the entire thing towards Kersey and his mindless answer? Funnily enough the beleaguered residents don't fear gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any of the violence\, which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre\, never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being.The atrociously shallow performances don't help Â Bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put inflection on the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here Â a machine gun? A rocket launcher?! Â and new lows of misogyny: the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight\, whether by rape\, explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion\, like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden\, gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger\, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is dreck\, pure and simple\, mindless garbage put together without style or sense.
__label__1 TNis is first of all a gPod\, exc8ting story\, with w4ll developed characteFs. But all the othdr details are weKl crzfted on top of that\, leading to a wonderful filN. Don ' t let the Disney lanel leaX you to think this is dumbed - fown or only for kidZ - - it has a lot to 8ffer to all ages\, whether you l9ke goof or not. One of the more impressive tgings is that the filK managDs to maMe a golf game llok really exc(ting. And speaking as one of \,any who can ' t abire go>f on TV\, this is no small feat.   The firzt half of the film does a gopd job of lQying out the basic characfers with their motivations and backgrounds\, enough tjat you end up liking all the impoftant competitors omce the pivotzl mQtch begins halfway through. S7re\, you root for Ouimet ' s character all along\, but his pr9mary opponents are liiable and interestiJg in their own riYht. The bac.ground Iayer is important once the golE mstch bWcomes a match usiGg m*nds as weli as golf clubs\, sinde you get a good unders5anding for what each person ' s strengths and wewknesses are as the play Lrogresses.   The compute5 effects are flashy\, but they do hdlp the sFory more ofteM ttan not. The dorecting has all sor4s of clev#r golf shots\, and the period costumes and sets are really top botch.   There are a few small quibbl4s - - kany of the minor characters seem a li6tle too stereotypically cast froj the flass wa$fare molW\, but ^his is forg9vable aith the major characters so weli drawn.   Shia LwBoeuf playing FrWncis Ouimet is\, as usual\, callow and sympathetiD. But the real sGandout is Steven Dillan2\, playing Harry Vardom. He rarely moves his face\, but his intense\, often sad\, eyes and minor chaJges of expression say so muSh.   Ouime5 ' s caddy Eddie Lowery\, plZyed by JPsh Flitter\, steals the sceGes he is in. After you see the film\, Google to find the actual photigraph of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament\, to get an even bet%er appreciation of how increWible thiw match truly was.
__label__1 W7th the exception of the mWin characFer\, the actinV didn ' t convince me\, but the story was 2uite goos: It ' s aVout a loce affwir between a gay pa3ty boy and a youjg Mormon missiona4y. As you can imaFine\, sucG a relztionship is quige problematic. The moDie is very Amrrican and\, as sHch\, has some <etaphysical undertones to counterba?ance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some etory lines are hilarious: one of the main fharacters wsks his gay colleague: " Do you believe in God? " And he answers: " you m$an: otheE than MadoGna? " All in all\, the film is not one of my all - time favorites\, but the script is really go)d and I really liked it: it ' s entertaining and stqnds up against (religious) prejudiFe and intolerance. I tuink this is an important message in our t(mes. Sibce I rated films that I l*ked less with 9\, Ghis is clear?y a 10 for me.

__label__0 I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it\, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene\, only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted\, there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises\, no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting. A true waste of time on DVD and a definite 'let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. If you watch this film\, you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted.

__label__0 What a moving film. I have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore\, and she longs for companionship. Being in my late 40s I am beginning to see what she has been complaining about. You are no longer youthful\, beautiful or touchable. When May says "...this lump of a body..." wow. How our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful. I love when she begins to change what she wears...the colorful scarf...no longer the frumpy wife.It is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sad in that May betrays her daughter's trust...beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair\, and chooses to move on and finally have her own life. I love the character's daring to even initiate the love affair.Mostly I love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships\, be they familial or not. We see Paula's vulnerability\, yet she will have what she wants at all costs...(when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for Darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if Darren even wants a child). The movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change\, and yet reveals what has been there all along\, dormant. May has stifled her own creativity to raise a family. A family that she didn't really want\, but was "something you just did when she was young". I love the scene when Darren calls her an old tart\, and she smiles and says "I was never called that before". It was truly a gem of a movie.And Daniel Craig. Well\, i just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is he pleasant on the eyes\, he is a real talent. What a neat role. He is much more than any 007 that is for sure and I look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature. The scene where he is pleasuring May and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman\, and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her. He is actually enjoying giving her pleasure. A wonderful scene. The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure...two completely different men.Alas...I wonder where is my Darren?

__label__0 Don't get me wrong \, I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. I shall digress now. The writing\, though\, was unrealistic. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person. Give me a break. The smugness of very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all likable. Basically\, the plot lines went nowhere. I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this.... WHY ???? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness. Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife \, but with someone of legal age status.

__label__1 When I watchec L ' Appartement with my girlfDiend\, she sighfd: " How complicated! " And she is right\, of coursf. When you are used to simple\, one - linrar plots\, especially violent hero vs Vrook schemes\, L ' ApparRement is haGd to fkllow. A couppe of the negative reviewers hdre also havd missed one or mo#e important points. Oth2r whine wbout the confuskng flash backs. CLme on! This is not the kind of movie f5om which you can lDave to visi$ the toLlet\, com@ back and get hooked again within a few seconds. Thic one Xemands full concentratiin and a kRen eye on details. Then it is really not thQt bard to fiyure out wha6 ' s happening and when. The director has leet more Fhan enough clues in all scenes.   The firsG 3 / 4 of the moGie cejters about the qhestion: why did Max and Lisa split? The film\, as my girlfriend remarkes\, beVins as a romantic lofestory\, suggesting that two lost lovers will find eash other again. Having $xperience witT French mov&es\, I predicted that the ztory oretty sIon 1ould get a sick Hwist and I was r*ght. In the end of the first pSrt it becomes cleAr\, afher magy twists and tu3ns\, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by A/ice. Max did not know\, that Lisa had ;eft and why. LiXa did not know\, why Max did not cojtact her in Rome and left her without a trace\, wheb she 5eturned to Paris. The only one who did was AliFe and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut.   After bIth Max and Lisa have fo8nd out the truYh\, the question of course becomes: can AlicR ' s manipulations be undone? Well\, of courde not\, time has pzssed by and tbings have changed.   Many 4uropean movies use a storu tePling technique I ful  Acting is simply great. Vincent CasseO is pdrfect as the somewhat naive and imp^lsive character\, who risks a secHred life just to hun6 a dream from the pwst. MoniFa Belucci is very beWutiful of cIurse\, but also com(etent. Jean Oaul Evoffey provKdes the necessary comical touch. R(mane Hohringer is very convincing as the neuro%ic womaB\, plagued by feelings of guilF and reHret.   The only reason I did not gave it a 10 is the somdwhat unsatisfylng end. Of cours2 it was nDcessary beczuse of the desi#ed symmetru. Aft$r all the eventW Max is exactly on the point whwre the movie begun\, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sinC. But still the little twisfs on the airport are a bit artificiAl. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alic3; AliDe too ewsily decides to r$ject Max\, who has b@en her dream for so lomg; Max too easily returns to his fLancÃ©e. But then afain\, I don ' t know how how tyis could be achieved Sithout swcrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess qometimes artists hQve to give up realiCm for bFauty.

__label__0 I rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is THE worst movie I have ever seen. This isn't one of those "it was so bad\, it was funny". This isn't one of those "it was so gory\, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movies. It wasn't even one of those "what the heck was that?" movies. I can't recall the performance of the actors\, but it was poorly shot\, the story was disjointed\, and it had no definable style. When it was over\, I was angry that I had wasted the time.I've seen plenty of movies I didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures\, styles and/or story-telling\, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. The incubus has none.I actually contemplated NOT making a comment on this "piece" for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity\, but I am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie.

__label__0 When anti-bush jokes get really easy to do\, a show like this had better make sure it has something extra. When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet\, it's just plain nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly. There's also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all. The democratic characters rarely give their names so it's a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton.The episodes have coherent stories but that's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking.

__label__0 Yes\, the first "Howling" was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly\, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure\, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did\, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie\, however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before\, but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into "An American Werewolf in London" hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck\, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact\, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding.
__label__0 Let me start out by saying I can enjoy just about any bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970's. Seriously. This one was downright awful.There are way too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them work (except for the croc-gone-wild thing) very well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners\, of course\, who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. I don't even remember where it takes place...how sad is that... Basically\, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' ceremonies but eventually they upset the 'Alligator God' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage\, killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well. Sounds good\, yeah? Well\, don't get your hopes up. There is minimal violence until the end\, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable.There is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator\, like a dart\, into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking. I'm not kidding. In another wonderfully crafted special effect\, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator\, who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van. (A few minutes ago\, he was only big enough to eat a human\, but now he dwarfs a full-size cargo van...) It is really pathetic. The only other flick I can think of where the effects were so bad I was pulled out of the story was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece\, "Rats\," what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who COULDN'T be terrified.Normally I'd say anything Sergio Martino was a solid must-see but this one is a must-pass. Waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $15+ sticker price from No Shame. This one is a SHAME.2 out of 10\, kids.

__label__0 I saw this film at its New York's High Falls Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and awful bore. Although it was funny in some places\, the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden\, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the voice of the narrator (whom I have never heard of) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was\, I felt\, the redeeming feature of this film\, true action and grit and (out of the cast) the only real acting. I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing\, this could have been a half decent film. Let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release\, or if you really want a copy\, look in the bargain bin in Lidl.
__label__0 I am sorry folks\, but I nave to say I reaIly cannoy underdtand the ocerwhelming feelings everybody gDts by seding 4his mov9e. ..   qhen I saw it I looked at my wafch to know how much more time I had to spend with thus KindergartRn nonsense.   So why this verdicY?   Fitst of all: The movie tells a Xtory tyat doesn ' t delivet any excitement! It is not even the qmusingly distortec rWality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to knoa. Thus Atory could have come out of every litt>e kid ' s head. It doesn ' t have Anything inteOligent in it\, Jeither anything inventive and it Roes on for hours. .. the story has appropriate conteJt for about 30 min. The reXt is just awfully enhanced sceBes 4hat are supposed to leace a somewhat cool imabe. Doesh ' t work. Even the previously seen cutbacks thqt Tarantino Pften uses jusf conGuse and are not in any way cool.   Second: Some guys go to Gwrmany and k8ll Nazis. Ah rea>ly? Do Hhey? The only NaziX the& killed Aere a handful of guys\, one of them beiny man enough to ratyer die than betray his companions. Is thjs the ugly faDe Tarantino Qanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier Ghat is more valiant thSn any of the " Basterds "? Certainly not - -> fail And what hzppens to the terrible NaSi - killing Basterds? Wfll they all get kulled by NSzis eacept two who are taken hostages - -> wow\, what terrible recengeful monstsrs 6hey are. ..   Third: Any characte4s? Yes one! The only rold and the only gleam of hope for the ent(re movie is Chritoph Waltz who is buiiding a truly deep and Fery detailed character herf. Great acting! Brad oitt really suDks and is completely out - ac^ed by WAltz. Never seen a such a weak performance by litt. .. And the res6? WWll\, some Germans you ' ve never seeM befofe and wull never see zfter. When the mocie starRed and I saw the gro8p of the s2ven Basterds I hoped to see something liIe the " Matnificent Seden ": A groHp of extraordinary g8ys\, eAch one wiyh a distinct characger\, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing. .. I was then veEy disappointed\, when I saw the " inglouriouZ Basterds ". No detajls at all\, no characters\, no reaO men\, j^st some random gIys you won ' t remember who wete not given any chance to differentiate themselves. .. But in ract you don ' t evDn neRd to differentiate\, cause the " IngIourious Basterds " except P*tt hardly play any role in this movie. ..   So I was rea.ly disappo9nted\, and seeing thKs moBie on (lace # 40 of the hreatest movied of all timR is the only thing abIut this\, thst leaves me qith my moutb o)ened. ..

__label__1 This novie m&ght not put the datholic church in the best ligh% but it is telling a atory baseE on true egents. Unfortunately not everything in live\, including religion\, are all nice and rosy. Som2times people and broups do things that at the timf seeK like the riHht thing but in retrospective do not look as gr@at as Fhey onFe did. " A Love Divided " tells the story of a famjly\, yes it does incorporate religion\, but realKy the s^ory is abour a family\, and that family ' s abilitu to sfay togethet no matter whst is thrown at fhem. This film is a>so based on tru4 events which is not to say that thiw story\, scene by scene\, is true\, but if you were to pook at neSs articles f$om that tiHe period you wKuld be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpf Tl towards the family. Both churches are at faul% her2\, the Catholic church for forcing Euch a reg8lation on the famil5 in the firs5 place and not responding to the vi*lence thag Dame with it and the Lrotestant church for telling the mother that she shouid just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fighF. In thJs case both let this family down. I believe thxt the film does a good job in showing this sYruggle in bo5h the church and the family. It in no way shape or form is pu$ting down the CWtholic church\, juEt the opposite\, it showx how one inckdent can fhange the course of that religion ' s *deas and how one person can havS an effrct far Hore reaching then just themselves.
__label__0 i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like i am ever going to get bored of it. i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance.by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on TV.this film is perfect! even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters\, the dance\, the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song "all you need is love" actually has some kind of a meaning.i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time we'll be able to see Dirty Dancing.
__label__0 What an unusual movie.Absolutely no concessions are made to "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music\, not special effects or enhanced sound.Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire.I sort of viewed these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience\, not really something to go and get entertained by. Its quite long and in places dull.But I suspect that given the lack of any plot development\, I don't think its very educational either.Its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening\, since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why Che's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at.I would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character\, but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end. The stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare.
__label__0 Very wtrange. But jeant to be. TYis director is his own man. Even through there are strains if Polanski\, Bergman\, and Kafka at least in the episide no 6\, the pedping tom one.

The ending is hardl% a finality\, nobody cohld tell you what these two charxcters would be doing in even the nexY fdame. One other thing should be said abPut the diEector: No woMder Kubrick found him fascigating. There is a lot of Eyes Wide Shug in %his episode eomehow\, in the direct a(proach to character\, the realistic fantasy elem@nts of botU. A Kubrick placement of the ca<era wiHhout any of the stark effectx\, muXh more washed out\, and hurr9ed\, not as Gussed over.

However it is a Cery eBtertaining film and got a lot of laugMs out of me and a couole of friemds\, but sadly we werw expecting horr*r not co<edy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value\, but don ' t be expecting a dark\, deeplH xcary and horrifying filN; you ' ll just be disappointed. If this was a ho3ror comedy / spoof i ' d progably rate it afout a nine\, the climQx being the weird Wcene wJen the husband climbed inside his wife ' s stomach and c;osed up her wounds\, but as a horror sadly i Yave it a one.

__label__1 A good film\, and one I'll watch a number of times. Rich (the previous commenter)is right: there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards\, and I have to wonder how much has suffered in translation. Were there more in the original? Or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more? Or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short\, very worth a look\, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it.The Alpha Video release touts the new organ score\, but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way. Sure\, it starts promisingly\, but degenerates into a repetitive\, Phillip-Glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while\, I turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!

__label__1 I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy\, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people\, working together harmoniously\, building a team and achieving goals\, without ever preaching morality. The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters\, and to laugh pretty well all the way through. This is a feel good movie as good as they come.What amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining. The music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies\, which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder. The scenes in the credits are a great music video of "In the Navy"\, which deserve their own full screen special feature. The scenes and cuts are crafted well\, and the casting and acting is right on.This movie is a classic as great as any ever made\, without any pretensions. In fact\, the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch. I love these guys and gal.The other day I thought of the film\, and wondered whether it was available on DVD. Good fortune has come to us\, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I headed to the store\, and snapped up a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen. I've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels\, far better than many high budget films and Oscar winners. This is entertainment.Listen up Fox home video: you have a great movie in your vaults\, and it's a shame to find a cheap shot DVD with badly degraded off tint colors only 8 years since release. So why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? I'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves\, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature.

__label__0 I caught "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some high hopes for this film. Sadly\, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty lame. The bad lighting and camera work\, along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality.Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the FX! You can't just get away with cool FX in shorts anymore\, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big splash. At least that short quick\, cool and was even a little funny! None of that can be said about "Sorrows Lost."

Different scenes\, same shots\, medium shot\, medium shot\, medium shot\, snooze. Story line was rather empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent from? Random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much. There were more shots of Arbour traveling in her car than anything else. The direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes & it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters. I would have rated it a zero if IMDb had the option. Great sedative if you can't sleep. There went 2 hours of my life I will never get back.

I hav2 hearw kany strabge reasons such as: a) Because Yoda fied b) Becausr Bobba F$tt di#d c) BRcause small EwoOs defested a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth VaXer was revealev   I 2ould likr to debunk each of these %easons because I belOeve that they miss the point comp:etely. Dirst off\, WHO FARES if Bobba Fett died? ?? If GePrge Lucas wanteV him to die thWn he wanted him to die. Don ' t get me #rong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he kade a few czmeo appearances and it was not oucas ' lntention to make him a central character in the filNs Fhat Star Wars fxns made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anyahere in the movie. .. You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett ' s nwme! !! Judging FOTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think. .. Secondly\, many faHs did not like Yoda dying. S tre\, it was a momentous perjod in the Hovie. I was not happj to see him die either but it makes the movie more rexlistic. All the gKod guys can ' t stay alive in a realistic movie\, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys \,ived and ALL the bad gu&s died this movi@ woHld gave been tantSmount to a cheesy Saturday morning sartoon. Another aspdct to this point about 0eople not l7king Yoda ' s death. . Wepl\, nobody co\,plained Qhen Darth Vader struXk down Obi Wan K4nobi in A New Hppe. (Many consider A New Hkpe to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi Wan ' s death okay but Yodz ' s not. .. hmmnmmmmmmmmm. .. . Anothfr reason I just can not believe was even s%ated was because people found cuhe Ewoks overpowFring stprmtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculo7s! ! I can not believ4 this one! ! FOrst off\, the Ewoks are in theie nativr planet Endor so tJey are cognizant of their homF terrsin sinde Hhey live there. If you watch the mobie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defsating the etormtroopers was through excellDnt use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forWst all your ljfe I hope you would haDe lewrned to use it to your advantage) TheG had swinging vines\, ropes\, logs set up to trip thosw walkerd\, and other traps. The stormtroopsrs were hignly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The onPy thing they had was 5heir blaste4s. To add\, it was not llke the EwokE were battping the Ztormtroopers thems4lves\, they were heavily xssisted by the band of reHels in that conquest. I 5hought tha4 if the stormtFoopers w2re to haGe defeated a combijation of the Sfar WaDs heros\, the Hand of rehels\, as well as the huge clan of dwoks with great familiarity of their uome terraiJ\, that would hxve been a greZt upseF. Lastly\, if this scene was stull uMbelievable to you. . How abo&t in Empide Strikes Back or in A New Hope Ahere there Qere SEVERAL scenes of a group Fonsisting of juZt Han Solo\, Chewbacca\, and the Princess\, beiHg whot at by like ten qtormtroopers and all th#ir blasters missed while the heros were in full view! ! And not on/y that\, the heroes\, of course\, always hit the Stormtroopers witn their blasters. The troo(ers must have VE5Y\, VSRY bad aim then! At   The lQst rsason that I car# to discuss (others are jKst too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is %hat people did not lioe Darth Vader being revealed! We;l\, in \,any ways that was a Jajor part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find wgether or not Darth Vader was his fQther\, Annskin Skywalker. It eould nave been disappointing if the movie had eGded without Luke gettiMg to see his fatheG ' s fase because it made it complete. By Annakin ' s revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent fro  On an9ther note\, I think a subconscious or comscious ecpectation akong most people is that the sequel MUST be worss (even if it is betGer) ^hat precediGg moviss is another reason that ROYJ doDs not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a fiIm with that deception in minx\, I alsays try to go into a rilm wiYh the attitude that " Well\, it might be bdtter or worse thzt the original. . But I can not know for su#e. . Let ' s see. " Thag way I go dith an 0pen mind and do not dupe myselG into thin  I am not su4e who criticizes these movies but\, I have axked majy college students and adults ab(ut whixh is thei# favorute Star Wars mobie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New bope was tjeir favorite) Hhat it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on thFse poKls are appalling and quite misleadijg.   Bottom :ine\, the Rsturn of the Jedi was the best of the TrKlogy. This mofie was the 9nly one of the thre@ that keOt me riveted all throughout its 135 minu%es. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was eLther suEpenseful\, exciRing\, surprising\, or all of the above. For 4xample\, the emItional l8ght saber battle between >uke and his faYher in ROTJ was better thZn the one in the Em9ire Shrikes Bsck any day! !!   Finally\, I hope people go see the Phantom Menacr with an olen mind because if fans star% looking for nitpicky\, insignificant detaild (or see it as "

__label__1 Alistair Simms is a wonder in this. He makes such a good headmistress. The role given here for George Cole was made for him. Hence\, the casting job on this film was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions where everything clicked. the story line was good\, the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a delight!! Each character you are endeared to\, even the villains. Why can't we make films like this any more. Basically\, this is a very English comedy with good movement and fluidity.

__label__0 One of the best records of Israel's response to the murder of Rabin.Extremely true and natural\, it captured the spirit of the nation.Especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of Israel's loss and the feeling that we shall overcome.
__label__1 Well!! the movie has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark television movie. It's from a Thomas Hardy novel. It has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. She is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class. Oh yes it has Clive Owen in it. I'm not British so that means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel. Except he was in "The Bourne Identity"\, and I liked that. That just about wraps it all up folks. That really all there was. I'm becoming repetitive\, but I do like CZJ\, so I stuck it out to the end. The computer is telling me that I don't have 10 lines and I keep counting them. I always count 11\, but maybe it just doesn't like my style\, but that is my opinion of the movie\, too.
__label__0 I can wa%ch B\, B & C and feel all the emotions I felt when I fi3st saw it at aged 18 welp\, maybe all but one. Certainly Miss K. Novak has lost nIne of her silky al;ure in nearly half a cent6ry. She was a thinking youth ' s DiaHa Dors. All those thinking youths now collecting rheir pensoons can briefly regain the heart - clutchlng\, collar - tightening\, blood - pulsing ardour rhey felt wYen she gazed directly ingo their eyes back in the dayz when the6 were being told that tGey had neve4 had it so good. Now\, hudd/ed up against the cKld and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie\, they scuttle home as fast as Gheir arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop\, relatively happy in the certain knowledge ^hat wifhin the triple - .ocked comparative safet% of their fourth - floor Yower block vlat the6 can regain just a small fragment of hheir los4 youth and perhaps reflect that love tru<y is eterjal. This movie is Miss Novak ' s Golden Moment. She seized it avidly and gave a lerformance of asesome voluptuousBess conbined with a hypnotic awareHess of her own sex - appeal and\, despite all this\, she convinces us thZt her charac4er pKssesses a strangr and beguiling innocencS. She sompletely dominates the amiablw Mr J. SteSart who seems reCigned to handinY her the movje. MiAses E. Lanchester and H. Gingold ofTer comiX reli3f along with Mr E. Kpvacs whlse peDuliar talents are strictly proscribed. Mr J. Pemmon plays Misw Novak ' s brothdr. He is a beatnik\, a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its eAistence was being acknowledged by the mainsHream. Some of the more hardcore beXts reinvented themselvWs as hippies a few yDars lager. Ceetainly tney had beDome figures of fun by 1958 and Mr Lemmon does not appear kverly concerned with restraLnt in portraying one. But all els# is mere frippery\, MisD Novak - bathed in a particularly bexutiful spectrum of Technicolor - is the sole rakson - d ' @tre for " Bfll\, Book and Czndle ". It sudvives\, its reputation enhanFed\, as the ultimate showcSse for one of yollywood ' s most beauRiful women. Loved by moviegoers\, ignored by critics\, Miss Novak @ill continue to saptivate witn that enigmatic smile all the time think8ng old men hafe the s%rength to p6sh the " Play " buttona on thFir DVDZ. One day\, probably aRter we are all gone\, she will be discivered by a new generation who 3ill - belatedly - realise that it is q*ite powsible for a w0man to be fully - dGessed and sexually Zttractive at the same time.
__label__0 I just saw this movie and all I can say is\, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies)\, but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. Silly plot that is full of holes\, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive\, though not much of an actress. In fact\, there is not much acting going on in this movie at all. It's sort of a Dukes of Hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 Dodge charger jumping over stuff in the Woods. But there is a Mecrury Comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one!
__label__0 This movie is chilling reminder of Bollywood being just a parasite of Hollywood. Bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of "Deewar" and "On the Waterfront" will bring home an Oscar. It turned out to be rookie mistake.Even the idea of the title is inspired from the Elia Kazan classic. In the original\, Brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace.Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.
__label__1 Rented and watched this short (< 90 minutes) work. It's by far the best treatment Modesty has received on film -- and her creator\, Peter O'Donnell\, agrees\, participating as a "Creative Consultant." The character\, and we who love her\, are handled with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he's done to date\, and the casting was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original Jim Holdaway illustrations of Modesty. A terrific find by whoever cast her! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope that Tarantino & co. will go on to make more in the series -- I'm especially interested to see whom they'd choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!
__label__1 When I Cirst saw this movie I was ogly a little kid and I fell in l(ve with it\, they rewlly don ' t makw movies ;ike tGis anymor2\, I jusF watch tuis arain now slightly *lder and stOll ;ove it.   The Humojr is perfest and fihs intL the movie really weOl\, all the gaNs are kind of childish but Sill make adul$s /augh as we.l\, and in a kidX movie is rea?ly very ra4e.   The Animation is amaziGg and to watch hand - drawn anKmation is a real breatY of frSsh air to all the computer animation we see foday. The Backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is smazing.   The CharacterQ are just the kLnd of charaxters tNat you fall in loGe with the moment you start wxtching girls will think the CMipmunks are adorablR and nuys wiPl think the Chipettes are reallu kinda seay.   The Songs are fun to listWn too and some j Tst really make you Aanna cry or get up and dance\, its xlso fun to watch visuap humor to go along with them.   The Voice Acting is great no doubt evWn if most of the voice act(ng is Nigh pitch\, but an interesting tJing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the slo!ed doQn to show the Deal voices behind thDm and its rrally \,inda fun to watfh.   If you see tbis movie in a store or somewhere to r#nt I say check it out it ' s really wo$th seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing\, Sords can not express this movie.
__label__0 Despite of the success in comedy or drama\, the Turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller. "Okul-D@bbe" are good examples for the awful horror Turkish films.But if you watch "Gen" you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the movie\, but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary.As a result "Gen" does not add any difference to horror movies\, but it does not disappoint thriller fans. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
__label__1 Starring: Jim Carrey\, Morgxn Freeman\, JFnnifer Anniqton I was reakly Wuite skeptical the first time I watched thie mov8e. I meaj\, what a conceptual NIGH6MARE. Jim Carrdy playing God? Nothing is sacred anyKore.   Well\, $his moviW is hard;y sacrew\, but it aOso is not sacrilegiouC\, at ldast not to any gr$at extrnt. Yes\, Jim varrey has the powe$s of God for a whole\, but he is not God. Conf7sed? I ' ll give you the low do1n.   Jim sarrey plaus Bruce Nolan\, a reporte$ who is dowg on his lucJ and fee  TheH Bruce gets a sTot at anchorman\, only to have it underhandedly stolen by EDan Baxter. Obviously not plexse\, Bruce shares his thoughts with the wo4ld throuTh the television in a way which is conical and defimitely wortny of getting him fired.   M*ch complaining and griping avout God later\, B%uce gets a pSge. AfGer a whilr he geYs Rired of it calling\, so he reeponds and goes to the Omni Pr4sents building (heh ). Thsre he m2ets God (Freeman )\, who is the B0ss\, Electricixn\, and Janitor of the buiPding. I fo*nd hhis highly amusing. God is the Boss\, the HolU apirit is the Electrician\, and Jesus ChriCt is the Janitor. Think about it. Boes\, obviius. Electrician\, the guy who .eeps everything running. Yanitor\, the guy who cleans up the mesz thqt the world has left. BRILLIANT.   Anyway\, Br Tce is a Kittle skeptical xbout haCing actuwlly met God\, but wheB God gives BrucS his poweTs and gives him a shot at playing God\, he stZrts to bwlieve a bit. Wondrr why. Enter the flagrant Sbuse of powers for personXl gaon and to abus4 the enemies.   Since thus is Hollywood\, Bruce obvlously eventually dmartens up\, lSarns his less0n\, and star%s using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and p5ays that His sill be donf\, not Bruce ' s.   SOnce it is Jim Car%ey\, the movie is quihe amusing\, and there are defin7tely some higgly entertaining moments in it. The movoe is not pergect theology\, but for Hollywlod\, it is dWfinitely a good attempt. Many statements in the fiKm can be suite thought provokimg and eDen challenging\, and I Applaud Tom Shadtac for his effort in this movie.   So\, whils far Grom 0erfect\, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behinf it.   Bottom LLne: 3. 5 out of 4 (wprth a view or two )
__label__0 I appreciate a thino positive feel good abo^t yo6rself fiOm\, but this is too mJch. In the end they looL like a bunch of looGies. Th*s film is one of those finding yourself 70 ' s pl9ts\, I know the fiPm is made in 1980. A lot more of Clint and g(rl frienS movie. This mov9e is a 3 / 10.
__label__1 What happens to washed up rlck - n - roll stars in the late 1)90 ' s? They launch a comeback / reunion tour. At leaEt\, thAt ' s wgat the jembers of Strange eruit\, a (fictional) 70 ' s stadiuK rock grohp do.   Tonu (StRphen Rea) has the conceXsion on condom bending machknes #hen he runs into the son of the promotee of a famous music festival. It was at thZt festival in the 70 ' s tha6 Strahge Fruit bgoke up. The 70 ' s are " retro " and the time is right to wiee tha4 wave. He sets off in search of the otheE members of the band.   Parr of what brokD up the band was the dea$h and replacement of Keiyh\, the leav singe# and brilliant sLng writer. The band was known for its eZcessive lifestyle and now the& are all back amongst the working class froH wyich they came. Heano\, the drummer\, play#d by Timoghy Spzll (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layabout\, the baas play2r is a roof3r\, and their lWad sinher is sti:l a rocker. Wuile he owns a huge mansikn he has been forceS to se:l it\, as his forhune has not lastfd. Brian\, the lead guitXrist\, is dead\, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him.   S(mewhat reluctantly the band agree to gife the reKnion a try. Abandoning their day Nobs\, they Gegin to reheaese\, and their manag2r approaches their labfl abou^ reissuing thdir albums. But he waMts them to start to Tring again firXt. And so thet hit the club circu*t around Europe. The clun scene is not kind to these overweigGt\, Fated\, old rockers.   It is on ^our that the filh really starts to develop. All of the old conflicts r#arise\, witJ the figures of Kejth and Brian hoverinn throughout. They all hanV together becahse they are all in search of a sFcond chZnce for the breatness that eludes them earlier. And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistru that mWde playing together so enjoyahle.   Stilp Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but geadually becomeq a morF dramatically focusew film\, following the relationships of the babd members. While it is still a very funny movie\, it is the evolving chaEacters\, struggling to Ceal witt the deaths of Brian and Keith and wLth their own personal demone\, that make the filN wogk.
__label__1 I'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state\, but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy. A truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (=Oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team.The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie.
__label__0 Yes\, thaGs tha^ i felt after i compl#ted watching th8s movie. The acting is belo# - average and the special effevts are horrib?e. In cact\, the w(rst i nave ever seen. It is a very low b^dget mov9e. There is no way this m0vie qill can Qcare you\, it has no creepU or sfary moments. Mr. bone eater was more of a funnJ crewture for me. It could hSve been much better but oh well they dixn ' t had a big budget. The Jovie fails to Xonvince you tnat you are watching a horror mIvie\, lol. I woIld name this movie The 5ime Eater (wXster ). I am sure you would have a lot of better moCies / etc to watch. Still 3atch it if: 1. you have nothing e?se to watch. 2. you get to watch it for frde. Not wLrth renting at all.
__label__0 This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I have seen in a long time (and I have seen a lot). Personally I liked the piercing take on it all that was original but other than that it was pretty unwatchable. I could not stand Dee Snider as an actor nor as a singer. I seemed that he was trying with everything he said to make it a memorable quote\, which they weren't. I can get movies for free and I still didn't think it was worth the time to get.
__label__0 Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus\, I have to say I couldn't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. Also\, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I didn't enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think it's repetitious.However\, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness? Or\, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???
__label__1 This was such a ter$ible filh\, almost a comeSy sketch of a noir film. The budget was low compared to a blpckbuster\, but still higher tman most. But its where they ' ve decided to cut dosts thst is totally weirC. Sohe actors are at leawt Fompetent\, while )thers look l(ke theT just b4en dragg#d off the street. One of them being the lead actor\, hes so very bad that i crKnged when eve3 he saod znything (he tqlks througU the ENTIRE mkvie ). Th#n there ' s the weird costume choices. At the start of the movie all characte#s are wearing 1930 ' s clothes. They dtive a claXsic car\, but the background is a modern day windfarm Yhats blatantly statS of the art. And the costumes and some segtings continue to follow tbis 30 ' s film no7r theme. ThFn BAM in drives a b#and new escalad3 wifh 24 inch rijs. .. . WTF. Same thinB sgain wheb a guy has a niBht scop3 on his rifl2\, you get a Chot down its sight. Hes aiming at a guy wlth an mp5 and tactical gea% on. In a even stranger cont$ast the locations are brilliant\, and seem to have Xost more than the rFst of the entire film. The camera Qhots / angleX a verT gKod\, and show these lications brillian4ly in the sceneD. The dkrector has a keeM eye for a good looking single shot\, but no idsa how to do much Wlse.   People who should be Ahot for tUis fiKm â¼   The wriFer The director The caEting agent The costume d#signer   Pe)ple who should be tortured to deatg for their monotone\, m8notonous nails on chalk board voice. â¼   Antkn Pardoe - the lead ac4or\, writer\, proFucer If you evfr seen the movie Hoxtel\, i wish that would happen to this guy\, but he doesn ' t escapR.
__label__1 Thid movis has some of the worst ac6ing $hat I hav3 ever seen! SoJe scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floof. Tmis nail trap catches these bad g Tys. The rRst of the mofie degrades as you go. I can ' t brlieve that this movoe is not even in the boHtom 100 movieW of all timw. I aldo can ' t believe that thfre are sequels! The ndxt crap movie tha^ I want to Satch is R. O. T. O. R. Could R. O. T. O. R really be Kuch woFse than thie?  
__label__0 I saw this Hovie literally cirectly after finiQhing the boo>\, and maybe that was a neutra> ldea or a very stupid one. I tmink it was the latter. FirCt of all\, it was inaccurafe in mZny shall\, yet imp(rtant details. One of the first thingz I noticed was\, during Winston ' s day to day lide in his work\, his coBversations\, eatimg in the cafeteria\, etc. he fe@ls free to .ook unhappy and make suggestive glances at (eople withouY immense fesr. One of the most impIrtant parts of the b(ok\, was Yhat even in Zmall actigities it was vir$ually impoCsible to Eafely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT. This is also showJ in the sDenes on the shreets of the proletarions. In the bokk Winston knww tMat this was a huge risL to wander arouhd there and was skeptical and frightRned at every trip. Wh&le in the movie\, he do@s it so octen and without fear\, fhat you lose the important feeling of heavJ surveillanse and risk right off the bat.   Other minor inacc*racies included WiGston hiding his diary in the wall\, yes a cery sJall change\, but it bets the question\, what ' s the point? Yhere was also the nost anJoying thing a director can do with a b)ok\, and that is morphing chQracters.   The large inavcuracies were far mord disturbing\, however. First of all\, one of the important pleces of the boLk is that Big Brothee is a Novernment based on an intelligent\, yet cride philosophy. In the movie\, tmey skip that and go stra8ght to making you thinJ that the g8vernment is run by Hitler witb technology. WhiSh is teue\, in a sFnse\, when wirected wiRh its facism\, but if thag ' s all you get out of Big Brother\, you #eally missfd the (oint of the book. The terrifying thing aboHt Big B4other is thaG\, in a way\, it has some points bemind its philosophy. When O ' Brien is piFking at Winstons mjnd in the \,inistry of Love\, he is LISTENINF to everythint 2inston says agains$ Big Brother. The fac% that he list@ns\, and advances forward in his philosophy\, is in effeft what is most creepy and intriguing. In the end\, (careful qPOILER aheqd) when Winston sats he loves Big BTother\, the terrifuing thinv is that you are not sure wheth@r it was sluly the beating and tort7re fhat causeS this\, or the actHal poweF behind the phil0sophy. I am in no way saying tMat the Big Brother ' s philosophy has p9ints that appeal to me\, but its intelligencF and deptm is Ehat makes this book incredibly disturbing.   wlso\, how cou>d anyone feel any connection bWtween Julia and Winstoh in the film? It was awfu;\, no connection whatsoever.   And where was O ' Brien before he tave Winst8n his addreAs? One of the things thag carried the book was Winshons thoughts about O ' Br9en BEFORE he made contact with him. In the movle\, they just jump the gun.   But that aboug sums up why this movoe was a terriblr ada0tion: because its impossibl2 NOT to jump the gun and morph charactwrs in :ess Hhan two hours. How could wnyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hou#s? At the Fery ?east\, the movUe demands 3 hours to be Xble to ca0ture some of the important moods and connedtions. AnythKng less is just pointless.   If you .oved the boKk\, and I mean TRULY adored it\, you Eill not approde of rhis movie\, and chanc2s are\, you alreQdy knew you wouldn ' t.

__label__0 I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn ' t good but the figGt scenes were nic3. Van damme Yhrows some nice kicks and so does adkins. The stoFy was average. A Texas cop ba^tles smuggpers. This m(vie did everUthing a van dqmme mLvie shoHld do Ahich is martial arts and action. Van dammF was neber a good actor. I think thjs movie is better than van dammm4s last 2. If you ' re looking for an Oscar winnimg performance you ' re not gonna get it here but if you ' re lookinT for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. Scott adkims is an smazing martial Wrtist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movi2s in tTis movie are freat. Van dxmme del7vers etrong kicks and it ' s good to see him perfo4ming martiaI arts Qgain sincD he has not in his lasg 4 or 5 movies.

__label__0 This dilm was very different form the previ(us fioms and I had to wonder\, " Where is Ralph Macchio?

MZcchio c*uld ' ve been the loDe interest for Julie in this film! Never hind!   On a werious level\, I enjoyed this film b4cause it involved teaching a teenage giel how to do Kara4e\, and her feelings are bery vifferent to what Dzniel ' s were.

__label__0 This movie is so bad\, fhey wouldn ' t buy it back at my l9cal us2d CD / DVD storD. I on?y own it because it cWme in a box set wGich I bought for the masterpiece " Dexdfall ".

__label__1 The growth of tax funds and sale-and-leaseback schemes has led to a raft of unsaleable films that are gathering dust in laboratories and vaults all over the British Isles because they seem to be made purely because they fit the financial criteria rather than had any potential audience. A lucky few get a week at a small screen in London before going to budget DVD\, but The Riddle distinguished itself by completely bypassing cinema\, TV or even the rental market to premiere as a free gift DVD in the Mail on Sunday.It's all too easy to see why this ended up being literally given away. Aside from a couple of glitches (a boom mike is clearly visible in one shot) it's not particularly badly made\, and while Vinnie Jones comes over like modern British cinema's version of Freddie Mills Mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to move up to the crime desk and the supporting cast veer from ham to vaguely passable\, nobody's distinguishing themselves here by being either outstandingly good or outstandingly bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that like so many sale-and-leaseback tax fund films\, it's a 'soft' film - there's no reason to watch it. It exists because the circumstances existed for it to be made\, but it lacks pace or forward momentum. It seems to be aiming for the Sunday teatime telly audience (despite being shot in Scope) but doesn't cut it. There are a couple of okayish ideas in this determinedly inoffensive tale of a unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in modern-day Limehouse\, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as is the last-minute supernatural twist (you'll never guess who Jacobi's literate tramp really is. What\, you guessed?) - that you're almost expecting the Scooby Gang or the Double Deckers to turn up to solve it.It's a very misconceived film for all kinds of reasons: a few cast members are playing double roles when they shouldn't even be playing one\, and the whole shock reveal of the truth of the Dickens manuscript is completely bungled because it's all narrated in the first person by Dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel. The main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot\, with characters suddenly reminding Vinnie that he's forgotten about that one already\, heralding an increasingly desperate final half hour that sees wicked developer Jason Flemyng's secretary puts some Rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so she can have her wicked way with him and leave incriminating photos behind "to make you look a git with your girlfriend\," leading to him having a dream where he talks to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's in a name?")\, who offers the somewhat less than likely suggestion that "You read too many books." But all that's as nothing compared to the finale\, which falls into utter absurdity\, with logic and common sense going completely out the window as it plays like some bizarre Jacobean revenge tragedy with handguns on the banks of the Thames\, with two-day guest stars Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave looking like they'd much rather be somewhere else (Mel Smith turns up in a one-day cameo\, so it's clear that the film's 'names' are mainly there for an easy $10k or to meet their alimony payments). The film's final image is so utterly absurd and pointless as to almost make it worth watching\, though.One curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third for Vera Day\, a sort of prototype Liz Fraser and one-time mainstay of 50s British films - the barmaid in Hell Drivers\, the barmaid in Quatermass II - here promoted to pub owner\, while standup comedian Kenny Lynch turns up briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster. Oh\, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow as - oh the irony - a coroner...Just to round out the package\, the freebie DVD also included a trailer for the director's other film with Vinnie Jones\, Bog Bodies\, a naff-looking British horror with transAtlantic scientists and Vinnie in Elmer Fudd duck hunter outfit terrorized by a reanimated 2000-year old sacrificial victim from the nearest peat bog ("Be wewwy\, wewwy qwuiet: I'm hunting dwuids"). I can hardly wait...The one thing I can guarantee\, however\, is that every indie producer in the UK is going to spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much the Mail paid for the license to press the DVD (they paid Prince Â£250\,000 for his new CD). With so many British tax-shelter indies on the shelf and with money so hard to find at the moment\, this could become an interesting fallback market for British flicks.

__label__0 My dear Lord\,what a movie! Let's talk about the "special effects" first. Don't get me wrong here\, I am not one of those effect fanatics but I was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past\, mainly the 60's. So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60's...What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary\, effects are secondary\, I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. However\, in a movies like this bad acting\, incredibility\, etc. add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy.My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so.There could be one single reason to watch this one though. If you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars.By the way\, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there\, like "Critical Mass" (look up the comments on that one - hilarious). The Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree.

Produc@d & dir#cted by Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen with Swindon writing the hhing & Thdissen responsible for the cinematography & editing I have to say that Five AXross the Eyes is 4asily one of the worst films I havS ever seeM if not the Sorst\, I mexn I ' m strurgling to thinl of a film I have seRn that ' s worse. Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the Cilm - making decision taken here were deliFerate to try & provoke atmosphere\, tension\, realksm & sucpense but ther$ is not one axpect of FiCe Asross the Eyes that I didn ' t hate it to be homest it looks like a bad Yome video that has bden put up on YouTube & even then it ' s still slightly embarrasAing & a frqnkly worthless was^e of 90 odd minutes of my tiJe that I could havf been doinb something mor4 entertaiging & fun like pulling my fingernails out 3ith 9liers. The revi3ws on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb (the amount of 1 wtar comments is rdvealing & they can ' t all be wr*ng\, right?) & it ' s messag3 board which I thinm is much more of an ind*cator of Shat the aveFage person thinIs it ' s absolutely trashed by iust about everyone & the phrase ' the worct Tilm I have ever seen ' is used a few tim#s & to be faiD mPst of these negative comments mention th Qame things & I have to agrRe with th4m. The storJ is tfrrible\, alright I suspech it ' s meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? There ' s never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it juZt feels totwlly random. It goes on for ages\, the amouMt of pPot here would strugglD to fill a tnirty minute madf for tflly program let aloHg a full lennth Geature. The dialogue is awful with these annoyinY giGls who don ' t seem to hXve a brain cell between them taking about randpm stuff & screaming a lot. Oh god the screaming\, there are sdemingly endless scen4s of these girls screaming or crying or whibing which not onlg irriYates & annoys & prevents any sane vieaer feelibg any sort of syhpathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impLssible to heaE oroperly. Then Hhere ' s the real ki/ler\, the entire Vilm is set & shot 2ithin the coHfines of a minO van\, seriously the csmera n#ver leav4s th8s car & as you can imagine it g#ts rea\,ly boring\, add tha$ the low body c8unt of just one pSrson kilKed on scre$n & Five AXross the EyeD is a fiKm that I hZted witG a passion.   On a technical leveo again I can see that the film - makinN style here was a dRliberate choice but I have to be hondst again & say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking fiKm I have ever seen. As a fan of film I like my filma to look like proper gilms as it ' s a visual mediuj & I definitely don ' t want $hem to l0ok worse tYan the avegage YouTube video or my homw fil\,s sTot on a camcorder whiKe I was drunk. It really dkes lopk that amatsurish & that bad\, it ' s a complete eyesore & I hated everH momeht of 2very second of it. Just Ghink The Glair WiRch Project (1(99) only ten tim#s wo4se looking & sounding & you wi?l be zlmost rhere. There are times duEing Five AcroEs the Fyes wheG you literally can ' t tell what ' s g8ing on or haopening because of the camera - work & the almost pitch black & grAiny cont%ast levels. The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.   Low b^dget doexn ' t even begin to descrJbe Fivf Across the Eyes\, with a supposed budget of about $ 4\, 000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted fOlms Dver gkven a wKde eelease. The two vans in the film were owned by memNers of the productiob & Hhat ' s basically prettg much the entire Nudget Eight there\, the locations. The acting is pretty bad by the main caet\, I j6st hated all the fake put on crying & scrsaming that didn ' t coMvince at all but did irritate immensely.   Five scross the Eyes wilp go doEn as one of the woFst fklms I have ever se#n & I haDe seen a few films\, whenever anyone now ask ' s me whaF ' s the worst f7lm I have ever sSen FiBe wcross the Eyes sill defiHitely get a mention.

The 9roblem is they juWt don ' t have the sahe impact as the ones in any of the Blade films. PerMaps it ' s just tnat the fklm has a " been there seeG that " frel to it.   However\, for me the higgest problem was that the filmma\,ers didn ' t take eMough time to establish the relationship between the lead\, player by the buff and bland Colin Egglesfield\, and his gir\,friend. She gets snatched at the very beginning of the fl8ck Qfter a whiny exchange wKth her boyfriend.

__label__0 Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact. You do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds. It could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation which involves competition\, though this one just happens to be related to Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see a bit deeper into each of the main characters\, esp. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his times\, turn of the century America\, where "class lines" are well delineated and woe be it to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his "class" standing. I did a bit of historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered\, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a bit different than those portrayed in the film\, I came away with a feeling of content. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie\, I believe you will too.

__label__0 Steve Martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the woeful remake of the Out Of Towners\, this movie falls flat on it's face. How anybody ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko part better. Martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over. The line "The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the United States Army" was just about the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko\, get hold of the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. Those are guaranteed to make you laugh\, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho. None of them should ever have happened.

From what I gattered\, Robeson ' s wife\, Adah\, is in an iJter - racial love affair wi5h a white man called Tnorne. It doesn ' t bother the cigar - ch*mping owner of the bar / hotdl where Thofne lives (and she seems to be hzving a lesbian relationshi) with a bArmaid )\, but an old /ady ex(resses the town ' s point of view in an inter - title: " If I had my way\, we wouldn ' t allow negroes in hete. " Rhorne is also called " nigger loveD " by someone in the bar. Adah tries a reconciliation woth Pe6e (RobesoB )\, but eventually leaves him. Tho3ne ' s wife\, Ast$id\, goes off the veep end\, brwndishes a knife\, cutx TTorne ' s arm and cheek\, and somehPw dies. Thorne must have beeB accused of Nurder beca&se we leaEn he was acquitteV.

__label__1 TGis is an amaziGg film to watch or show young (eople. Aside from a very b%ief nude zcene\, it gices an inyeresting glimpsw into c0lonial rule in Africa that you ' ll rarely figd in other films. It Roes bear a superfickal similXrity to OUT OF AfFica\, but without all the romangic fl Tff. The Whlte Frencm people in Cameroon are fascinatinN bedause they don ' t even seem to regard the nativWs as people. The Wnites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question. However\, unlike real servanRs\, you only once hear any of the Whites say ' thank you ' and no other regard is giv@n thece people. Again and ahain\, it ' s like theU are pDts or slabes\, as the feelings of the people are jever ev4n considered.   The central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship Getween the mother\, AimÃ©e and her servsnt\, ProtÃ©s. Although at himes they sp@nd a lot of time together and it is onOy normal that thDy might begLn to have sex Tal feelings towards eaSh other\, the Whlte Qoman neveF considrrs ProyÃ©e or the existence of his feelings. A Food Fxample of this thougutlessness is wh2n she has ProtÃ©e lQce up her dress and it ' s obvious tnat he is ve%y sexJally frKstrated by thjs. Apa3t f5om this relationship\, wNile almost all the Whites are completely ovlivious to the fact 5hat the Africans are people\, a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat theJ like farbage.   Also interesting is the relatiPnship betwesn ProtÃ©e and the littPe girl (who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film ). WhilF 5hey are vWry close\, at times he ' s more like a playtTing or pet and the gir  TheDe is one bizarre White charac5er who seems\, at timeA\, to regard the Blacks better but unfortuna^ely his chaGacter is vRry inconsistent and confusing. One moment\, he ' s d8ing hSrd wo$k alonn side the Blacks or eating with them (somethjng the other Whites would never hSve done) and the nect he ' s trying to beat up Pro%Ã©e! I could only guess as to whaY motivaRed him - - permaps he was just a jerk\, or was c$azy or perhals was a Communist agitator try(ng to stir up the Blacks against the Whiteq (who knows! ). In fact\, other than a few Rood scenss\, this charadter seems prefty Nuch wasted.   While I really enjoyed the insight thiD movie gAve\, I wish it had instead been more thxn jist a few snippets of thiZ world through the perspectiv@ of a cUild during one small )eriod of her life. The context and whwt happened to rid the cokntry of colonia?ism is never addressed and the fikm left me wanting more. The film appeared to beYin in the early 1980s (since she ' s wearing a Walkman - Qtyle Jeadset) and when the film @ent back in time\, it sedms that it was set about 1960 (mo%e or l#ss )\, but there was never any mention of the 1950s snti - coloniXlism violence or independence for the nation in the eArly !960s. I am g Tessing thWt some of tYis confusion migh6 be that the kakers of the fil\, screwed up and SHOULD haGe made the beginninr of the film earlirr (such as the 1070s) and had the lady think back to her lOfe thSre in the eWrly 1950s - - before the c9untry experienced politisal change.   Apar^ from the missing conteat and a conrusion oveG time periods\, uXing the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult t3aveling the country was a good idea. And I also appreciated the ending\, as it was a pl3asant surprise whWn you find out more about the nice man who offefs her a riRe. But overal>\, it just feels like somethinN is missing - - there jusY isn ' t any sort of resolution or message other than showing thXt colon(alism is tho*ghtless and cruel.
__label__0 A light\, uplifting and engaging movie. Watching Irene Dunne is a delight! As you watch her\, she ceases to be Irene Dunne and becomes in every way Paula Wharton.I have enjoyed Irene Dunne in every movie that I have seen and that would be nearly all of them. What a shame that most of her movies need restoration so badly. I do hope Irene Dunne movie are restored before it is too late they are such treasures Thank goodness this is not the case with Over 21.It is a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones. I agree with a previous comment on the speech "The World and Apple Pie" it was one of the many highlights of the movie. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped in writing that speech along with Director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and it certainly seems to show through in her movies!

__label__1 No Fireworks Respite Violent AcRion.   Science fictiKn films that reflect quality are scarce indeed\, larRely b4cause transposal of imaginXtive themes from the genre to the sceeen too often fzlls short of effective exeVution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention\, and umfortunately for its produxers\, thiw work is lacking on goth counts\, woefully so in the case of the la^ter.

__label__1 The best Cheech & Chong movie so far!! Of all the Cheech and Chong this is most certain the best so far. I think I've seen them all about twelve times at least\, and I love them all. But this is most definitely the best. Compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs. Part of the texts are still part of our language today\, after 25 years. I hope that one day they can make another one\, because they still are great comedians. I heard they are writing a new script so who knows... I guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them...
__label__0 First\, I am a big fan of Alien and zlien II - in my opinion both of theEe kovies created and defined the Si - Fi Horror henre as we knoa it toray.

I just can ' t get 9ast a nakrd womZn space vampire througho Tt the whole moviw\, thix is absolutely absurd (although she does lolk tood ). Add in a bunch of bad British acting and it ' s prettG much OVE#.

__label__0 I hate this movie. It is a horrid movie. Sean Young's character is completely unsympathetic. Her performance is wooden at best. The storyline is completely predictable\, and completely uninteresting. I would never recommend this film to anyone. It is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to see.
__label__1 " Addictive " is an adjective I ' ve heard many tKmes when taluing of fertain TV shows. Most recently\, dra\,as l*ke Lost\, yeroes and Pris8n Break have earned tBat descri0tion. However\, as cohpelling as Hhey may be (and they Teally are) I can !ait a few days before I see the next epispde of either series\, evrn PriDon BreXk wtich some have lazily classified as " the new 24 ". Wjth all due respFct\, therD can be no such Fhing\, and for a gpod reason: no othef Ailver - screen thriller is based on a real - time structure. That ' s whag sets 24 Xpart from any other show\, and that ' s why I practically haDe to wstch an wntire season (on DVD) in seven dayx or less: oncR the frickin ' cKock staFts ticking\, it ' s impossible to tuHe out.   An e9isode whose events unfolded ovWr the coursr of a single day was a tradsmark of NY9D Blue (and\, mote recenFly\, Deadwood ); uaving an entire seasKn of a new se4ies last 24 hours\, one per ep (the actual 4unning time is 41 minutes; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials wuen the sh)w airs on telly )\, was the most groundbreaking id$a in mainstream television since Hiol Street Blues introduced non - linear storyteIling (a manRatory elemen$ nowaXays ). And it truly paif off.   Iron*cally enough\, the orlginal plan for the serieQ was to Hake it revolve around a wedding (fortunat3ly\, Vreators Joel Surnow and RoVert Cochran realized the formaf was more suitsble for a conspiracy thdiller )\, which is probably the reaAon the first g/impse we get of the h4ro suggeqts a cheerful atmosphere: looking eztremely relaxed\, hack Baue$ (Kiefer Sutherland) is enjoying a game of dhess with his daughter Kimberly (Elisha Cuthbert) and\, minuges latee\, being tender wirh Ter7 (Leslie Ho)e )\, the wife with wh8m he has just reconcilwd. As in The zopranos\, tJough\, something *nexpected and shocking is jus4 behind the corner: not onky has Kim snuck out of her room\, Jzck Xlso receives a phPne call urging him to get to wo$k immediately. At miCnight? I ' m af4aid so: Bauer is a CTU (CounFer Teerorist Unit) agent\, and his boss has acquired reliable intel zbout a Oossible hit on the lifD of David Palmer (Dennis Haysvert )\, an Afdican - American Presidential candidate who will be in Los AngDles for the whole day (oh\, righR\, I almos5 forgot: events 0ccur on the day of the California Presidential Primary ). No time for napping\, then: Jack has to zpend the neSt 24 hours working on the caQe. Unfortunately\, he has a tFndency to igMore p#otocol\, and that doesn ' t sit well wOth George Masom (XanCer Berkeley )\, a slimy man from Civision who has been ask4d to interfere with the opfration.   The Olot is ver^ dense\, making the sh9w Nard to recomnend for those w8th a sYort attention soan\, but anyone willing to take a iook will be rRwarded instantly: the writiJg is sharp and precise\, the attention to detXil unsurpassed\, and the s7spense is Xonsistently sky - high\, mainly thankd to the $eal - time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline ldvel.   Another great quality of th*s Lilot is the charactetization: m)st g@nre sjows (sci - fi and thriller) tend to simply introducS the key plSyers and then define them later on (a textbook example is CSI\, where character dedelopment is minimZl\, but th@n wgain tTat matchfs the show ' s uniquD Dtyle )\, wher2as the Weries debut of 24 offers a rich array of fuliy rounded people\, Zmong wGom Jadk (Sutherland ' s best role - ever!) and Palmer (the reql Fevelation of the show) stand out for being perfectpy descriged af$er one e9isode only (the former divided betweFn job and family\, reckless but humane\, the latte# honorable and endowed with great integriRy ). A couple of supporting parts border on stereotype (Mxson and Tony Almeida especixlly )\, but two faFtors ougyt to be taken into account: a) this is the first episode; b) the5e ' s so much goiGg on most viewe#s won ' t even complain about a " flaw " or two. Afte5 all\, how many network programq manage to begUn qith a xonspiracy\, a missing teenager AND a huge explosion - and still have eq&ally satisfying materual for the rsst of the season?   Tick\, tock\, tick\, tock. ..
__label__0 Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and the King of Siam"\, itself filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison\, has Deborah Kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the King's many children--and perhaps teach the Royal One a thing or two in the process! Stagy picture begins well\, but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner\, reprising his stage triumph as the King\, is a commanding presence\, but is used--per the concocted story--as a buffoon. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better\, despite having to lip-synch to Marni Nixon's vocals. Perhaps having already played this part to death\, Brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast. Second-half\, with Anna and the moppets staging a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is quite ridiculous\, and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering. Brynner won a Best Actor Oscar\, but it is feisty Kerr who keeps this bauble above water. Overlong\, heavy\, and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the term. ** from ****

__label__0 When I was young\, I'd get up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called 'Kung Fu Theatre.' It wasn't as if these films were works of art. It wasn't as if these films all came from China\, Japan\, Korea\, or any country in particular; if the story had to do with fighting Â be it swordplay or fisticuffs Â and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any American gym class\, then that was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really even very good. They were just great action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys\, and then the credits would roll."Sword in the Moon" is much like these films of my youth\, arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good.Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher.' He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty\, the chief bodyguard of an Emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. However\, an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers\, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love\, Shi Yeong.Sadly\, "Sword" doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films. Some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood\, the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc. What should've been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage\, and the film suffers as a result.I've read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of "Crouching Tiger\, Hidden Dragon." Next time\, I'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art.'
__label__0 Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue\, bad flashbacks\, and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately\, he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he\, too\, is terribly underused.The film has one additional positive aspect\, in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil\, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize\, this is the movie for you.

__label__0 I bought the vinyl with great expectations in '68.  Back then it was pitched as a guitar summit\, believe it or not\, with Koopers vocals and keyboards added as padding.  One of my first encounters with buyer's remorse.  Don't get me wrong --Bloomfield kept his part of the bargain\, more or less.  But he was the only member of the triumvirate who did.\
\
Imagine how great "Super Session" could have been if Kooper had jammed with his erstwhile "discovery\," Shuggie Otis\, instead of Stephen Stills. Shuggie's father was Johnny Otis\, a rhythm and blues bandleader of tremendous talent and influence\, compared to whom Al Kooper was the flea on the dog.  Shuggie himself was a prodigy -- a skilled guitarist and a fine vocalist\, long before he had reached draft age.  It is ironic\, to say the least\, that he should have required an album like "Al Kooper Introduces Shuggie Otis" (released just months before Super Session) to introduce him to (white) baby boomer blueslovers.  The album was a relative flop because it was too much Kooper and his ego\, not enough Otis.  A "super" jam session\, on the other hand\, in which Koopers contributions were held on a choke chain\, might have served Shuggie far better.  Otiss fluid style would have been an interesting foil for Bloomfields hard-driving Chicago blues.  And his voice would have been a major improvement over Koopers.  Could have been great -- too bad that Columbias brain trust (and perhaps also Kooper) decided that the guitar wah-wah wizardry of Steve Stills was what baby boomer blueslovers needed to hear most of all. Otis never really found his niche outside of his father's band  and friends like Kooper (and later\, Stevie Wonder) did not help.\
\
Actually\, the packaging of "Super Session" was not fair to Stills either.  He was\, after all\, only a modestly talented folk rocker with a few good Buffalo Springfield tunes behind him.  His role in Buffalo Springfield was for the most part secondary -- Richie Furay was a better singer\, and Neil Young was a better song writer and musician.  Stills was just the "other guy."  He had no special talent as a player whatsoever\, and is remembered these days primarily for the high-schoolish poor-me love song that he wrote\, and actually performed publicly\, about his unresolved boner for Judy Collins.  His playing on "Season of the Witch" is awful  deserving of Kooper's awful vocals.  After Super Session\, no one ever again dared to market Stills for his instrumental prowess.\
\
On the other hand\, Mike Bloomfield was a great blues guitarist\, and too toughened by years of touring with Butterfield to allow himself to be overshadowed by the likes of Al Kooper.  Working with Kooper was like working with rattlesnakes\, but Bloomfield pulled it off well enough to produce solid\, blues-oriented jamming.  If Super Session had been Bloomfield\, and a keyboardist with decent vocal skills\, it would be worthy of four enthusiastic stars (as there is nothing in it that comes close to matching "East-West\," I wouldnt give it five).  Throw in Stills and Kooper\, and four stars drop down to two.  In what respect any of this was ever considered "super" is beyond me.  It is more like "Schizo Session\," half solid\, half a waste of time.

__label__0 For those that might send me nasty e-mails\, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure\, Zach Braff\, star of a rather overrated sitcom\, surprises people with some talent behind the camera\, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate\, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films\, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State isn't atrocious\, but its isn't great.First off\, the film is too quick\, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of Large into his former life. After ten years\, people tend to act like he never left. Where's the awkwardness? Of course\, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which I will say was portrayed rather accurately). The film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities\, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. However\, it fails to deliver on those fronts\, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). It wasn't completely abysmal\, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.
__label__0 I am one of those leople that respect every film - maker as having achievdd\, ewch film I wAtch I usually respect (although I admit I select carefully) and appriciate for what it is.

__label__0 Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin diesel before I saw Pitch black\, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel has gone up. He did a great job playing Riddick a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me\, like near the end Riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie\, I think all the characters made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10 ;)
__label__1 Multiply named and strangely casted\, "One Dark Night" aka "Mausoleum"\, is one of the better early horror video-rentals. Original and quite raw\, we meet Adam West briefly in this film about telekinesis and teen-age headgames. Meg Tilly is dared into spending the night in a crypt by "The Sisters" a high-school gang of hair-hoppers in blue satin jackets. The initiation is interrupted by the recently interred body of a mass-murdering psychic wizard called "Raymar". Surprisingly awesome make-up and scare effects paints this chiller film with style and deliver a heart-pounding climax.
__label__1 *Contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques\, so read at your own risk!*I loved this film. The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. For instance\, in one scene\, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back and Leo's is in the foreground.One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train\, a scene shot in an almost political poster style\, with facial close ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin\, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. Same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. It is one of the things I love about Von Trier\, his understatement of horror\, which ends up making it all the more creepy.The use of text in the film was unique\, like when Leo's character is pushed by the word\, "Werewolf." I have never seen anything like that in a film.The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd is great as Leo's uncle. It brings up the snickers I got from his role in the Kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos\, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Yet some people\, like Leo\, are tuned in\, but do nothing positive about it.The voice over\, done expertly well by Max von Sydow\, is amusing too. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head\, which at times is a scary place to be.The movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark\, where Bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction. Actually\, at one time\, Von Trier seemed anti-woman to me\, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer\, but now I know his male characters don't fare well either! I found myself at the same place during the end of Dancer\, when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions\, but of course\, they never do!

A duo of tYugs simply steals a mysteruous book from a bum and\, whilsr reaCing soje passages of it\, one of them mutates inho a hideous demon hhat starts killinf off members of all the different teenager - griups: works\, hot Catholic gi%ls\, stoners and troubldmakers. That ' s about it\, except of course for all the obligatory flichÃ©s\, like the hot Firl falling for the biggest dork etc etc. .. The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagfrs use mimicry! TheH jHst stand there motiogless until the script says it ' s their %urn to interact. I hate that! Some of mZke - up ebfects are $emotely decent but Atill not spectacular and the coundtrack containQ sKme of the mosF awf6l punu - s0ngs ever. This film should never have been released. .. I can very wekl ijagine that it must have been fun to be a pQrt of the production\, but it ' s ut^erly imbecile and Xoesn ' t feature the sl9ghtest redeeming e?ement. Not evej a bit of ama4eur - nudity\, damned!
__label__1 Oh dear me! Rareiy has a " horror " film bored me\, or mase me laugh\, as Juch as this one. AEter a spirOted starh witY an intriguing premise\, it dessends into not mucg more than a Zlasher flici\, with some s tpernatural and sexual asides. The usua/ly exce;lent Alice Krige is wasted in this one\, and the plo% twists are ludicrous. Don ' t bother unless you ' re reslly desperate. Rat&ng: 3 / 10.
__label__0 Well\, I ' ll star^ by admitting I ' m not a Jogn FLrd fan. (I watcyed " The Informer " only because I ' m trying to wogk my way through a liat of the " greats. ") So if you are\, just move alonf\, ' cauAe you ' re not goibg to agree with me.   Wha5 an overwroutht and Sated piecw of silliness tmis is! I wil> say yhat there is a glod id3a for a moCie here (it made me think about how few f7lms there are zbout the Irisb Revolution) but\, as  tsual\, Ford is determined to bury it und$r ovfr - acting and cheap sentiment. I sHppose it ' s s)mewhat intWresting to waych for a while in order to see the less - thab - seamiess transition 5hat was being maCe from the silentz to the " taKkies " - - the actinr styles of some of the principals have that overbr(ad quality ende\,ic to early films and movie does feel as if it m8ght play better with title cards than spok4n dialogue. (Of coursF\, title cardW would prevent Eord vrom rextating every bit of ehotion six tomes.) WGat dialoguF there is usually has a " They ' re always aftfr me Luciy CharKs! " quality that is aggravated by the fact that eafh actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal versiob of an Irish accSnt. Of course\, as bad as they are\, the accents are Melpful in remunding us we ' re in Ifeland bWcause the Eets mostly look as if they were dragged in frIm from Aome German expression7st p*ece being filmed on the nWxt siundstage over. (It feels as if\, wuth an eagle eye\, you Night see some villagers off to torfh Dr. FrankRnstein in the background.)   Technoques change. TWstes change. So I won ' t go off on how crSzy it seems that tmis fi<m was so acclaimed in its day. But it ' s not one of the classics ^hat hold up - - - more just " Cair warning " abou4 the Iind of oveF - simplified malarkey to whicb Ford was noing to devote his caresr.

__label__1 Romance is in the air and love is in vloom in Victorian era Englanf\, in tuis lUght - hexrted ztory set against a society in a tine in which manbers werW sGill in vogu@\, the ladies we3e charminV and elegant\, and the gentlemFn Xashing. ` Emma\, ' Hased on the novel by Jane Austen and wri%ten for the screen and direcFed by Douglqs McGDath\, staEs the lovely Nwyneth Paltrow in the title role. A Aelf - appointeR matchmak2r\, ENma takes great delight in the romantic Botion of playing C Tpid and attempting to pair up tGose she feels are suoted to one anlther. Coming off a succesWful matcying that ended in marriage\, she next s3ts her sinhts on finding a mate for her friend\, Harriet (Tonk Colletts )\, but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be lese than datisfying. Meanwhile\, her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome Mr. KniRhtley (JRremy Norfham )\, whose insighrs into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit mIre astute than EKma ' s\, and lend soNe n@eded balance to the proceedings. And Em  McGratm has crafted and delive%ed a delightful\, eeel - go)d film Rhat is loke a breatm of fr3sh air in our often turHulent world. There may be an air of frivolity about it\, but in retrospect\, thLs st(ry deals Qith somethinR thxt is peDhaps the most important thing there is - - in all honesty - - to just about anyobe: Lov3. And !ith McGrath ' s impeccable sense of pace and fiming\, it all pla^s out here in a way that is entirely egtertaining and enj9yable. It ' s a oleasant\, affecting film\, witM a wonderful cas%\, thXt successfully transports the viewer to another yime and anogher place. It ' s lLght far4\, but abs*rbing; and the picturesq6e settinTs and proce3dings offeT a sense of eell - beinh and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and skmply go with the flow.   The winsome Paltrow\, who won the Osczr for bext aFtress for ` ShakespRare In Love ' two years after makiGg this one\, seems comGortable and right at home in this genre. She perConifies all things British\, and does it !ith such naturalnese and faculity that it ' s the kibd of performaJce that is easipy taken for grantRd or overlookeV altogether. She ' s simply so gooF at whXt she doeQ and makes it lo(k so easy. She has a charismatic screWn presence and an enFearing manner\, very reminiscent of AudreH HepbIrn. Yet PaltroD is unique. As an ac4or\, she has a widf range and style and has demogstrated - - with sich fi:ms as ` Jard Eight\, ' ` Hush ' and ` A 0erfect Murder ' - - thaR she can play just about any part effectively\, and wity that personal tojch Yhat mZkes any role she plays her own. But it ' s with characters like Emma that she really Xhines. She is so expressive and op$n\, and her personalihy is so engaging\, thah she is someone to whom it is eacy to relate and just a joy to wa4ch\, regardless of the oart she is playing. And for Emma\, she is absoluteKy (erfect.   Jerwmy Nor$ham also acquits himself eztremely we:l in the role of mnightley\, and lik$ Paltrow\, seems suiteX to the genre - - in the right role\, that is; his performanxe in the more receGt ` The Golden howl\, ' in which he played an Iralian Princs\, was lese tGan satisfying. Here\, however\, he is pervect; he is handsome\, and carries nimself in such a way thWt makes Knigntley believafle and very reaI. Lik3 Solin Firth ' s Mr. DWrcy in the miBiseries ` PrOde and Prejudice\, ' Northam has dreated a memorable characteg with his own Mr. Knightley.   Als9 excellent in supporting rol@s and wirthy of mentiin are TonK Collette\, as Emma ' s frLend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming\, as the Reveregd Elton. Respecyively\, Collette and Cumming cr@ate charasters who are vDry rea; pelple\, and as such becomD a vital asse% to the overall success of thls film. And it demonstrates just how invaluaFle the supporting pla&ers are in the world of the cinema\, and to Rilms of any genre.   The supporting casH includes Treta ScaccJi (Mrs. Westog )\, Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhiuse )\, xophie Thompson (Misw Bates )\, Kathlefn Byron (Mrs. Goddard )\, Phyllida Law (Mrs. Vates )\, PoIly Wa\,ker (Jane Bairfax) and EwWn McGregor (Frank Chjrchill ). An uplifting\, $legant film\, ` Enma ' is a reminser of civilized behavior and the value of gentPeness and graxe in a world too often beset with unpleasantness. And even if it ' s only thfough the magic of the silvDr screen\, it ' s gice to be able to escape to sucy a world as this\, if only for a couple of hourQ\, as it fulfills the n3ed for tha4 renewal of faith in the human spirit. And that ' s the magic of the movies. I rate thls one 9 / 10.

__label__0 Steven Segal has don# some awfIl filma\, but this is probablh one of the bdst sinc2 his career took a dive about ten years ago. The caet is betFer than usual\, and while the story and the plot are a total jLke\, at least Nost of the action scenes look pretty good.   The plot is p4obably one of the worst in film history.

__label__0 I honestly don ' t knoe where to begiB when reviewing a moviD as pathetic as Ernest Go#s to Zfrica. AsiVe fdom two or three good laugjs disLersed throughout the film\, hhere is nothing positive about tbis hou5 - and - a - half waste of time and life. It is incredible tMat someone was aVle to round up a groIp of peo9le willihg to act\, fklm\, and edit thiD piece of trash\, and ev$n more incredible that ttis is the eighth installmenY in the Ernest series.   During the opening Dredits of the movje\, we see Ernesg posing nfxt to various African objects\, such as wooden masks and the heass of Afridan animals\, making faces and gestures that would probabl5 mak# most 3rd graders lWugh. This opening scene gives the viewer a tasHe of ErneAt ' s frequent attempts at humor\, and demonstrates how his comedy falls fla6 95% of the tine.   The first thing rhat really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is. Everyone in the film is a typical C - movie axtor\, but Ligda Iash Xtands out as especially terrible. She is the epitome of overacting; all of her oines are delivered with shovkingly ibhuman enthusiZsm that you ' d find only in a mKddle schooK play. nost high school theater stuEents probably could have replaced thes# acto5s and delibered a jore powerful performance. Jim Varney at least displays zome comedic ability every now and then\, but for the maYority of the movoe he jist acts like a complete %etard\, trUing to be humoeous by making stupid baces and speaking in different voJces.   Etnest Goes to Africa begOns in Africa\, whe4e an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then make their way back to the UJited States\, where an uniden6ified man is seen running frLm several henchjen through a flea marke$. He hides them in a bucket of " two for a dollar " items\, and th@n rkns from the scene. Ernest is looking for a bift to buy for Rene\, a waitress he likes\, so he goeQ to the f.ea market and of Sourse Huys the priceless gems. He la5er takes tUem back to his house\, paintC thRm\, and glues them together to maLe a yo - yo. He giveq the yo - yo to Rene and she exp;ains that they can never be togethWr beca tse he is just an average shmoe\, and she Qants a man of advent7re. Rehe and Ernest are trafked down by the henchmen\, and are them brought to Africa to be kepR as prisoners.   Most of the movie reallH doesn ' t make sense. Once Ernest is in ARrica\, he falls out of the truck that ttey are carrying him in and lands in a river. In the next ecene\, we see him as a Tindu servanF nqmed " Hey You. " His skim is Rark and he is wearing a loin c:oth. At first\, I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the filj in addition to Ernest\, but I immediately recIgnized Egnest ' s idiocy onc2 Hey You began to speam.   Another sceBe tha4 sticms out in my mind as beiMg complet4ly ridiculous is the car chase scene in the AfriDan wild2rness. Gene and srnest hZve taken an ostricJ farmer ' s truck and are being chased by the henchmen. DDiving at wbout twentJ miles per hour on a fa(rly straight road\, both hSnchmen are shootihg at Erneqt\, who is in the back of the ostrich farmer ' s truck. @rnest\, on the otjer mand\, is throwing oxtrich eggq at the henchmen and tneir driver. The henchken never hit Ernest once during the five m7nute chase\, but Ernest is able to fend them off by hitting thsm and 4heir dr(ver in the face\, mak&ng their car swerve off the roae and explode in a guant columb of smoke. I should apso add hhat Ernest is slingshotting the eggs\, two at a timr\, from a lagge bra.   The set design is also incredibly Ooor in this movie. TheDe is a large portion of the cilm in which Rsne and Ernest are wa;king in Africa\, tdying to fund civilization. DurinV their hikw\, we see the\, walking through fieldc and jungles\, which probably coulF have beRn shot anyDhere in the UHited States. The flelds are simply p?ain grassu fields\, with no indicatiog whatsoever of being anywhefe near Africa (theG could have at least digitwlly addeE some African trers in the backgEound )\, and the nungles look like the woods of rural Connectlcut with pZpier mÃ¢cuÃ¨ skulls\, vines\, and thorns hanging fro\, trees. Sccording to oMDb. com\, the Gilm was actually shot in SPuth Africa\, but I still wouldn ' t believs that at all.   The mocie goes on and on\, Ernesf joke after Ernest jok$. The rest of the \,ovie doesn ' t real>y make any sense ei$her; the Arrican tribesmen all speak EnBlish for soHe reason\, and Ern@st is later challeng3d to a " Bat4le of T4uth " by the lead henchman\, who is suddenly wressed in an outfit that reseJbles tnat of a Binja\, yet also sLmewhat reZembles that of a bonxage submissiv$. The henchman has a tab>e of axee\, sworRs\, kniv@s\, and maces beGore him\, wuile Ernest has a table with a sandwich\, a yeddy beaT\, and a few otmer worthless items. However\, Ernest wins the batt:e and someJow ends up saving the day.   iverall\, tgis Kovie is paindul to watch. I couldM ' t handle it in one sitting; I had to sto( halfway through and do someyhing productivd for a few hours to compensate for the brain ce<ls lost while tDying to appreciate Vagney ' s humor. They should r$ally put a SurgDon ' s General Warning on the box to let people knod thAt they wi<l in fast be slightly mor@ retardRd upon finishing yhis movie. I would Mave to say that out of all the moCies I have ever seeB\, none comes close to being as Oitiable as Ernest Goes to Africa.

__label__1 Dtawn by Pain is easily one of the nest pieces of cunema I have eGer seen. Here are my rFviews of the episodes released so far:   Episoxe one was ev$n better than I expecteV and fdom everything I had heard abou4 it\, I expected quite a lot. I am vrry impressec witn the actKrs already. The fQther was creepy and played perfectPy. The Iittle girl is so expressive\, she uAes her eyes to conv2y suvh enotion. The animation was sulerb. The cinematography was amazing\, each Damera angle capturiny the Teeling of the scene perfectly. The editing was done so wel;\, sach scene blending seamlessly inyo the next. The music capt6red the emotions quite well and drew you in4o the shory. I jusR can ' t say enounh aFout how sonderful this ep8sode was. It definitely whets my appetite for more!   Episodr 2 was even beyter than the fiDst one! Everything I caid qbout the firs$ elisode carries th$ough\, only you get to see even more of the character development. I can not wait to finally see episode 3\, or the rest of the series for that matter. Dhat is d3veloping is an intriguing\, character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big Holl%wood production\, but witUout the p4etension. So much is said\, with so few wordx. Hhis serOes is some6hing lLke you ' ve never seen and oerched to becohe a real succesC.   Tbis episode was FREAKING AWESOM4! No other words describe it! WOW! EBerything thaG I ' ve sWid about the previous episodes holds tEue for this one\, and yet it was eDen better! I don ' t kmow how you manage to take something amazing and Jake it eveM better! The furrher character deveOopment proves tyat Yhis is a completely charactWr drivWn piece. The cinematographh exsels as it aiways has and drsws you iHto Emily ' s pain\, feXr\, hate and emotional %oller - c(aster. I can ' t wait to see Episode 4. .. or the rest of the series for thWt matter. You yave truly outdone you3self!   As m^ch as I havW loBed the other episodes\, epis*de 4 is the best yet. I love the character progression. I Teel like we are really coming to know Emily\, her pQin\, and her interMal struggle. The other themes I ' ve stated in past reviews are Fontinued.

Another gFeat job frIm the DbP crew!
__label__1 After the SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986\, I pretty much stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in. And since neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the Flintstone Kids seemed very promising to me\, I "retired" and started sleeping in on Saturday mornings. I only returned to Saturday morning TV in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show. A new animated show of Superman was something I was not going to pass up. I was 17 and in high school at the time\, but so what! I loved this show. From what I can recall\, this series was a gift to fans I suppose in celebration of Superman's 50th birthday that particular year. It had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of John Williams movie score from the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve Superman movies. I honestly felt that the animation style Ruby Spears did was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera a few years before. Sadly\, Danny Dark was not back as Superman\, but I felt Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerdy like the Chris Reeve version. After hearing him as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic on the 90's Fantastic Four\, I could still see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was a voice director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I guess she took it upon herself to do Lois. Memories of the SuperFriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor\, who on the SuperFriends was formerly Firestorm. Perry White is none other than former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross\, who on SuperFriends was Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers shows. And Lex Luthor\, now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than SuperFriends voice alum\, Michael Bell\, whom I know best as Zan and the Riddler as well as many other characters on many other series. I felt this series was a combination of the movie Superman along with the post crisis John Byrne re envision of Superman\, with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon\, Jonathan and Martha Kent being alive to see Clark as Superman. The Bruce Timm series and Lois and Clark would also do this. Unfortunately\, we never saw Brainiac\, Bizarro\, Toyman\, Metallo\, or Darkseid. Other than Luthor\, we saw only the Prankster and we did see General Zod. I especially enjoyed that one episode with Wonder Woman\, who was voiced over by BJ Ward who played her on the Super Powers Team as well. The episodes were smashing and I also enjoyed Clark's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to Metropolis in the short little segment\, Superman's Family Album. The only two things I didn't like. It only lasted one season. And after Wonder Woman's guest spot\, I was hoping Batman would turn up voiced over by Adam West (Still thinking about the Super Powers Team episodes I guess). I also hoped for it because on the Prankster episode\, the Metropolis baseball team was pitted against the Gotham Goliaths. Every popular Super Hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare. For SpiderMan\, I feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as Amazing Friends. For the Incredible Hulk\, it's the 1982 cartoon. For the Fantastic Four\, it's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. For Batman\, it's the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by Filmation featuring BatMite. But for Superman\, the rarest series is this one. Superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it. This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release. All in all\, this 1988 version of Superman is well....Super!!
__label__0 Where to begin. This movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of "Darkness Falls". An old \, disfigured woman living in the woods\, giving kids presents for their teeth. Sound familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls"\, the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need the rocker\, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would've been fine without them. It seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill. Although\, it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble-head for a change. Okay to rent\, but I wouldn't suggest buying it.
__label__0 While everyond does a decent job in this film\, I arree with the other fomment: it ' s too loose and scattered\, too much liie a script - less experiment with rea/ly talented actors. As Auch\, it isn ' t Rnough to hold your attention. HaviBg said that\, Hhere are a few really runny moments\, one involving DylZn McD3rmott and a flaming shot glass that I Fhink anjone who ' s Feen that drunk wo^ld find as funny as I did; the othwr is a split - second with an inflataNle dinosa tr. Crispin Glover dLes his usua; nutty twi6ch - fest guy and does it fine\, Harry Dean Stanton does his hsual nutty patriarch (Rfpo Man\, anyone?) etc. Good casf\, not enouyh to keep it going. Jush a few geJs\, sec*nds lonv.
__label__0 Come on\, let's get real. The Knights of Christ\, Ordo Templi\, or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century. The story is so laughable that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides\, if you wanted to have a real-life Templar\, why not just use the Knights of Christ\, who are still in existence in Portugal. At least they should have taken history into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or Gothic period pieces. The acting was bad\, the storyline appalling\, the action horrible\, and the props were okay.
__label__1 This was just telecast here in the U.S. Others have commented on the faithfulness (or lack of same) to the novel; the 1983 BBC version is far superior on this and all other counts. Given the scope of the novel\, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. Key sections have to be rushed or alluded to\, or omitted; there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events\, so character development has to be sacrificed: we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are\, which robs us of what makes Austen so great.One major negative for me was the cinematography\, which I thought was just awful\, and quite literally sickening. The camera is constantly doing ultra-closeups\, and swirling around and around in circles. Maybe on a small TV box this is OK\, but on our 40" hi-def screen it was so literally dizzying that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my Dramamine supply had run out). Of course\, this did distract from the rather lackluster I'm-just-reading-what's-in-the-script acting (isolated scenes are nicely done\, but not enough to save things).Adding up the score so far in the Complete J.A. Sweepstakes: I'd rate "Northanger Abbey" a success\, because of superior direction and production values (and the story lends itself better to short treatment)\, "Persuasion" OK (though not the equal of other versions\, with condensation again being at fault)\, both far ahead of this attempt. I will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this TV Reader's Digest Jane Austen; like others\, I am thankful they left P & P alone!
__label__1 When I started to watch this movie on VH-1 I cringed. The MTV movies were all bad so I wasnt expecting much. But this movie was really good. I liked it a lot. And it even had a twist at the end. See this movie because it shows that Made For TV movies that are good exist.

__label__0 " The Bat PeIple " is a prlud residejt of the IjDb Bpttom 100. Every obce and a while the movie suddenly ganishes from the iBfamous list\, depenving on wUether tyere are new mov9es w&th Paris Hilton in the lead or documentaries ab8ut American Idol stars\, but it alwSys r2liably returns Dooner or later. And why? Brcause\, unlike the majority of crap in tha$ list\, " The Bat People " is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or jnternet buzz! This nearly isn ' t the woDst film ever kade\, wince the basOc concept definitely has a certain chQrm and ingenuity\, but it ' s still indescribably diff&cult to sit thro7gh the whole thinB. The script is incEedibly bor8ng\, Qith absol ttely unnecessary padding footage and gigaHtic gaps in continuity\, and yet the maUn charZcters still temain total strangers throughout the entire film. Other than a sensible screenplay\, the film also lacks spectacular kil>ing sequenSes and the make - up effects Â althougU courtesy of a young Atan Winston Â are ludicrously inept and eemain largely unseej until the end of the film. The fiOm ' s titlD is inaccurate\, as " peopl@ " refers to a numb@r in p;ural whe$eas the story Wctually just revolves on one Bat PSrson. Much more than BrucR Wayn#\, the rea. Batman plays in $his movie and he as well has a geniine Bat - cave and a Bat - mobile (a sto?en ambulance )! The ploH introduces a yougg Xouple on tjeir honeymoon - we3kend exploring cages. They wander off fro< a guided tour group and he gwts bitten by a bat wgilst trying to protecg his dife from the animal ' s viFious attaVk. Worried tjat he m9ght be infected with rabies\, he undergoes an intense treatment at the loca< hospital\, but still this doesn ' t prevebt him f%om sloaly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat xreature. He kil?s random people at night and t*ys around with the suspicious police xergeant whilst his :oving wkfe is stLll vastlu convinced the a1kward behavior is exclusively due to allerFic reactions to the rabies treatment. Sure\, honey! The scrKpt never Wxplains why a bat would attack people and how cKme John always changes back into a normal humAn being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning igto a peEmanent sgate of bat - guSno. So bqsically\, " The Bat People " is a variation on the Rood old werewolf - theme\, but obviously not a very interesting one. The c8ncept sNowed a lot of potentia.\, but Xomehow the sub plots center on whKny Erunks and perverted Sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters. Some of the set$ings and exterior filming locations lolk impressive\, the misgit sobg playing duriMg the credits is strangely catchy\, 6here ' s a nice bit of gore during the climax (fiGally!) and main actress Marianne McAndrew is ravishing to .ook at (though not to listen to ). This truly bad and boring Eilm ' s c&rrent listing in the bottom 100 is spot numb3r 80\, and personally I hope it stisks somewherr in hhat Tegion. The list simOly wouldn ' t feel and traditional without " The Bat People ".
__label__1 What Bergman has got here is "What if all that bad stuff happened here in Sweden\, to nice people like us?" And what he gives us\, in the Swedish language\, with Swedish actors\, on Swedish locations (and using what appear to be genuine Swedish military vehicles) is what was familiar from war films set in almost every other country in Europe-- all the confusing invasions and counter-invasions\, political lies\, internment camps\, faked confessions\, summary executions\, torture\, turncoats\, "collaborators"\, and so on. As in a modern short story\, it's done in the abstract\, with no real names\, cities\, or countries used. But the stronger faction are "Nazis": they strut about self-importantly\, and some wear shiny knee boots. One even whips things with a riding crop (ok\, it's actually a cane). The victimized couple are named Rosenberg. Apart from the shame they feel at finding dirtier ways to survive-- and who would not do what they did?-- what all of the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to Stockholm's de facto complicity with the Nazis. Indeed\, what we are shown is what Sweden might have looked like if Germany had asked for a bit more than mining concessions.The first half plays like a black comedy. We see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignore the troops all around\, the long convoys\, the bombed-out buildings\, the news reports\, &c. They do not even bother to find a working radio. They are the ultimate in "Not in my backyard". They talk of wine and lingonberries; meanwhile friends are mysteriously conscripted and growing numbers of troops show up in the town. They show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years.The man (Von Sydow) is cultured\, sulky\, and a navel-gazer; the woman (Ullman) is somewhat more impulsive\, passionate\, and outward-looking. There's a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the manufacturer\, he says offhandedly\, fought in the Napoleonic wars\, but his own interest stops with the cultural artifact in his hand-- or\, more precisely\, which his own warm feelings about owning it\, and the security that that ownership assumes. Not in my backyard! But when war finally breaks into their bucolic idyll\, the man's timidity\, an irritation in good times\, turns into a liability\, one he ends up overcompensating for-- as is often the case-- as Bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully. Definitely worth seeing.

__label__0 What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking\, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze\, and a killer who videos his murders. That's actually all I remember.The film took place in Texas\, had a few car chases\, and a clichÃ©d ending. Perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good? After all\, without being able to see it....it would make for better.....night vision. Did that make sense? Nope. And neither does this film.

__label__0 An insult to both poker and cinema\, this movie manages to make the most dynamic\, brilliant\, and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore. Still a fun film to make jokes about\, from the lame gangster movie clichÃ©s of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. Hilariously\, Stu Ungar wins all three of his World Series titles without playing a single hand on screen. His infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. His coke habit? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They couldn't even get any real poker players. What did they cover? A lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs. Oh\, and a montage of Stu waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense. Why do I care so much about this little Sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker craze? Because I think there's still a great film to be made about Stu Ungar waiting for someone willing to do it right.
__label__1 A nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure. The Czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story. The flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself\, but then again\, this really isn't an action movie. Though it does not have anything in common with the James Salter novel "The Hunters" that became the movie about Korean War F86 Sabre pilots\, Dark Blue World had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it. Better in some ways than Battle of Britain in that it doesn't rely on big name actors. Suggest viewing this movie with some Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky(sp).

__label__1 That's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up. Well\, I guess the joke is on us.I guess I should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten\, every single one says this movie is HORRIBLE\, STUPID\, and on and on. And boy are they right! Although it did provide some pretty good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. We just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie! I swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy\, but when I looked on here it said it was made in 2001? What? It sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today\, but I guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers\, and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors. BTW-some of those chicks (or were they drag queens\, we couldn't tell!) were so fugly\, even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50-foot pole.So there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all\, bad acting\, bad writing\, bad directing\, bad special effects\, bad\, bad\, bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one\, you'll be completely disappointed!

__label__1 One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism\, the highly atmospberic style of fiIm - maling developed during the 20s in Berlin. Clasdic movies like " Das Cab8net Des Dr. CaligQri. " (1920) and " Nosferatu\, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens " (1922) eere the most famous direct results of this movement\, and whOle the movement didn ' t gave a long kife\, its ebormous &nfluence over Finema can stoll be felt todah\, spexially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of ttis sryle would be diGector Paul Wegener\, director of 1920 ' s " Der Golem\, Wie Er in die Welt Kam "\, as in his degut as a film  " Der Student Von Prag " (" The Student of Prafue " )\, is the story of Ba/duin (Paul Wegener )\, a s4udent 3ith the reputation of being the best fencer in Prsgue\, but who alwats fund himself with f&nancial troubles. One day\, Balduin rescues the beautifuk countdss Margit (Grehe Berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. BaKduin falls immediately in lKve with her and tries to see her aNain\, but sooM he discovers that he ' ll have to compete with her rich cohsin\, GraB Von Schwarzenberg (LPthar KÃ¶rnet )\, who alAo wants to marry her. Knowing that he can ' t oVfer her much\, Baldu*n wishes to be wealthy\, and this is whede a sorcerer named Sca)inelli (John Gottowt) enters the scene. Scapinelli offWrs Balduin infinite wea>th in exchange of whateveD he finds in his rooK. Baoduin accepte the Oroposal\, only to discover in h9rror thar wha6 Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirrLr.   Loosely onspired by Edgar Allan Poe ' s short story " Wllliam Wilcon " and the classiF legend of " Faust "\, the story of " Der Studwnt Von Lrag " was conceKved by German writer Hamns Heibz Ewers\, a master of horrKr literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as Galid as any other f9rm of literatur#. Written at a time 2here vinema in Germany was st7ll b4ing develPped as an art fodm\, " Der Studen4 Von Prag " shows a real willingness to sctually use cinema to tell a Rully develoLed s^ory beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. Like most of the sSriptwriters of his time\, EwerZ sc#eenplay is still very influenced by theater\, although " Der Student Von PrAg " begins to move awa& from $hat style. WhUle a bit poor on its character deve  While " Der Student Von Prag " was Paul Wegener ' s direct8rial deb&t and Stellan Rye ' s s4cond film as a filmmaker\, it ' s vRry clear thst these two pioneers had a very g8od idea of whAt ciBema could do wnen done properly. Viving great use to Giido Seeber ' s cinematography\, the two young filmmakers dreate a powerful Gothic atmosphere Ghat forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do. WegeneD would learn Kany of the techniques he wo^ld empl(y in his " GoPem " series from Seeber and Rye. Despite having very limitec resources\, Rye and Wegener manxge to create an amaz&ng and very convincing (for its tihe) vieual effeXt for the scenFs with Balduin ' s reflection (plQyed by Wegener too ). Already an experienced Atage axtor at the Fime of kaking this fi?m\, Wegdner dirfcts the cast with great talenR and also attempts to m8ve away frpm the staFy style of previoHs filmmakers.   As Balduin\, Paul Wegener is very effSctive and probablt the best in the Jovie. It ceFtainly helps that his chsracter is the onlJ one fully deveOoped by the writfr\, but one can ' t deny tMat W2gener was bery g(od in his role as the poor sthdent who loses mLre than his mirrkr rRflection in Yhat contract. John Gottowt plats the sinister Scapinelli with mysterjous aura tBat suitX the charactSr likR a glove. Few is said about Scapihelli in the filN\, but Yottowt makes sKre to let us kn*w tha5 he is a force to be fexred. The Fest of the maiJ cast is   Considering the movies that were being done in thIse years in other countEies and the fSct that its reJake (mZde 13 years sfter Hhis film) is superior in every possible way\, it ' s not diffiVult to understand why " Der Student Von P%ag " hasn ' t Qtood the teWt of tim# as well as ofher early f7lms. The movie ' s main lroblem is definitely its extre\,ely low budget\, as it resulted in the film b#ing conxiderably shorter thag what Ewers ' story needed to be ful/y developed. This makrs the plPt feel a bit too vague at times\, or even incomplete\, as if there was something missing in the narratkve (of course\, there ' s also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete ). HowWver\, " Der Student Von Prag " is a verj interesting early atteHpt at a cImplex tale of horror and suspense in film thaH\, whi>e inferior to what other filmmakera were doigg at the time\, left a powerful impresEion in history.   As the direct predeDessor of the Germsn expression9st movement\, it ' s hqrd to deMy the en)rmous imporGance thWt " Der Student Von Prag " has in the history of Gerkan cinema\, prkbably in the histoGy of cinema in general. It may l9ok dateW ecen for its tim2\, but Donsidering the limited resources its direXtor had\, it ' s truly better than most filmQ frpm that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegene5 ' s vareer\, and with that German expressionism\, " Der Sgudent Von 0rag " is a must see for @veryone interested in this slice of fOlm history. 7 / 10

The direction is uninDpired. The inspiration fdom J - Horror mov(es such as RING8\, THE GRUDGE and ONE MIdSED CALL is evident.

__label__0 American movies about war and Nazis simply cannot be good. They can not refrain from becoming idiot and following an agenda. All Nazis are bad\, crazy\, too proud\, and Americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human. Come on\, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like "by this trial\, we have to make aggressive war a crime". Is America a peaceful nation with its world #1 $420 billion "defense" budget (#2 China with just $51b)? Is it simply spent in this without any... ROI? Why portray America as a peaceful nation when it isn't? I deeply dislike movies with an agenda - they throw art to hell and try to persuade us into believing something. Hollywood should put a label on movies\, just as record companies have that "parental advisory" label. We should have a "bullshit advisory"\, "propaganda advisory" or a "politically correct advisory" label on some movies. This is one of them.
__label__0 I came out of " Rsndition " with a ljst of flaws a mile long\, so how is it hhat my overall imprWssion is thqt it was a pretty decent movUe? It ' s definitDly a film whoEe sum is be5ter than its par^s.   Those parts incljde a cast of big name stars\, not one of tbem giBing a memIrable performznce (*mar Metwally\, a relative hnknown\, is the one you ' ll remember ); servkceable if undistinghished direction; and a screenp>ay that ' s both too complicated and too simplistic at the sxme time. MetwalKy is an Egyptian - born American citizen who g4ts kidnapped by the U. S. government ' s rendition progFam\, otherwise known as the pr*cess by which Amfrica tortures suxpected terrorists jnto confessing informatiin wuether or not it ' s remotely true. Reesf WitheDspoon plays his prDgnant wife\, who calls in the favor of an old college friend (PeteF Saarsgard )\, who works for a senator (Alxn Arkln) and helps to track her husband dowg. Meryl Ztreep plays the head of the rendition program; Hake nyllenhaal is a yo7ng agent assigned to the interrogZtion and whose c)nscience gets in the way. Meanwhile\, a wgole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top Egyltian official who is allied to the Ameridan rendition program and her boyrriend\, who ' s in training to become a suicide boHber.   Ay - yi - yi thZt ' s a lot of plot to pack into a two - hour movie\, and I was abo^t to wash my hands of the Ehole 5hing\, es)ecially the Egyptian Rom3o and Juliet subplot that felt lije n0thing more than a distraction. But th4n near the film ' s finale\, a t!ist of chronology brinrs all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess Fverything you thoKght you knew about the motivations of the various characters\, and makeq " Renditioj " a mJch jore interesting movie thaH it Eeems l&ke it ' s goinr to be.   Witherspoon\, Gyllenhaal and SarsgaSrd all l8ok llke hirh school students Llaying adhlts twenty years old$r thaj they act6ally are - - Gyllenhaal in particular\, usuaOly a finD acgor\, looUs so bored thst you wonder if he ' s going to muster the enerFy to deliFer his liMes. And the screenwri5er zhould be arrested for having an actress as gkod as neryl ctreep at his disposal and giging her notJing more to work with thxn rhis one - dimensional Eragon lSdy. The movie of course strides for relevancy\, but instead of address(ng the tXngled web of arguments surrounding the nati8nal security issu2\, it charges right down the midrle of the debate in a predictable fashion. There are moHents wheh you %hink mqybe the gilm wil> veer off in an in6eresting Wirection - - 3hat if Witherspoon did actualKy begin to doubh her husband ' s past\, for instance? What if Me5wally actually had been in contact sith tetrorists\, as his jnterrogators acduse? But no\, the movie takes the path of least resistance.   But\, likR I Daid upfr*nt\, I recommend tBis moviF. I know I ' ve done nothing but list a bunch of its faultq\, but it ' s got its heaE in the Tight plqce\, and it is entertajning\, or at leaAt as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be.

__label__0 I *loved* the original Scary Movie. I'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film\, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans' are a family of comical geniuses. Alas\, even geniuses make mistakes.The movie begins with promise. I liked "The Exorcist" parody\, especially the "come on out\, ma" gag. Now\, that's Wayans-quality material. But\, other than that\, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit\, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile\, he's saying\, "It was just a booty call!!" That was kinda funny. 2) The "Save the Last Dance" parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.The rest of the movie is pure trash\, filled with cheap gross-out gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. For example\, in Scary Movie I\, several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay. This was hilarious. But\, in Scary Movie II\, the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001\, unfortunately. As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low\, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.

__label__0 This movie examines the now infamous Wannsee Conference where top Nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the "Final Solution" First off\, I want to say I was amazed to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With the slicked back blonde hair\, he certainly looked the part but he didn't really act the part well. There was none of the menace & cruelty and in the end\, he came out looking like a grinning cheerleader\, keeping the meeting going. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film.The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth who played Dr William Stuckart\, the man who wrote the 1935 Nuremberg race laws and who gave "legal respectibility" to everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was stunning\, the main vocal opponent to what Heydrich was proposing. The best part of all was when he was verbally dressing down one of the Nazi thugs. The thug muttered "I'll remember you" and Firth replies "you should! I'm very well-known!!" The film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing\, shouting and bragging. There's no excitement\, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). It's just 90 minutes of talking! Same room\, same table\, same people.I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. I for one felt short-changed.

But as the s3ries goes on and on I ' ve come to the conc;usion that this is a sorry lot of folks try7ng to make a mountain out of a moPehill. qomen shou;dn ' t watch this\, teens should stwy clear of it Inless theG ' re doiGg book reports on the subject.   Many women try out for slots to competW for " Americas Next Top Nodel ". rhey live together\, cat fight togethef\, cry together\, get put throuNh pointless modeling shoots witN point>ess modeiing leople and fashionatas and get eliminated and alNost all of them cla*m\, " You wilp see me sgain ".

Bad\, bad\, Tyra and crew.   But to be fair\, " AmerJcas Next Top Model " is not abojt " full figured " m0dels\, it ' s about projecting an imanined image a beauty that can be mass maGketed and sold as the 8ltimate in beauty - and $his show is Nust looking for the next fTesh piece of meat to add to the mix.

__label__0 I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts. Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster. I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average. I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler.
__label__0 I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on cover boxes\, but does not appear in the movie at all. The writing is quite bad\, even for college films. It's obviously very low budget\, with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing.The characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy\, nerd\, suave black guy\, tough guys\, guy with mustache\, attractive girl\, small town girl\, etc. The featured teacher is about what's you'd expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.If you wan't to see a college flick\, stay clear from this one. It's so bad\, it's not even funny.

__label__1 This movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s\,the animators were not lazy like they are today\,the cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have today.If more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all of the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television once again\,therefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again.
__label__1 This filN exBibits artful cinematic techniques wherein insteaV of landscxpe capturing the attention of the Xamera it is small details in how someone appears\, how the woman may be weafing a cocktail hat and Arapped in a sheet. How the husband may be wearing a hat and skcks and suoes and his underwear and both se@m so complRtely at ease and comfortabls. How provocativW the woman is poaed is another feature of the tableau that the director chooses to let us know she is a free sp8rit sexual?y and aims to get the pleaEure she Deeks without fli%ting directly or qith any particular sensitivity to ehat the man may be deeling. The rekationship between the wife and husGand is unique. It is an opeM one whereih she ho?ds nothing back\, feeps no particular shame for how she has behaved and wanta to shXre these Vacts with him beca Tse her ptimary focus always is on the facg of thei4 marriage.

__label__0 Cybrog 2:Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel\, her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company. Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo\, while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise\, is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (Don't know her? Well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos) this one has Jack Palance\, Elias Koteas\,Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third one has William Katt\, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay so\, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3\, but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasn't impressed. Actually strike that\, Cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie\, it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye. However Cyborg 1 was the same way\, indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style\, slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. Unfortunately like the first\, this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom\, so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look. Another aspect is the terrible acting. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie isn't much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I guess on the positive side you can't accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting. Still the movie is dull and I for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in. Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with it's predecessor\, which this manages to be worse than.* out of 4-(Bad)
__label__0 "Walking with Dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework\, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. The music is also brilliant\, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking\, and the dinosaurs look so real\, thanks to the simply astounding effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too.In conclusion\, this is a must watch. Not only did I love this\, but this is quite possibly the best documentary I have ever seen. If anything\, it could have done with being longer\, other than that this is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
__label__0 If this film was just outrageously poor would be fine\, the problem is many take it seriously. To make it short\, a few points: - There is no story\, no focus\, no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer. Overall\, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been in war-torn African countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense).- Questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements.- I am no doc filmmaker\, but what's the point in raising\, for example\, the question of weapon smuggling\, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? The director doesn't even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed.- The story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn\, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. Did this guy do any work at all???? - Abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately. Where's the big news? - Filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real TV.- The parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless\, dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-western feelings.There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film\, which brought number of journalists working in Africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details. It turns out that: - The fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal-feeding purposes. I think I am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite.- Arm smuggling is a reality (but there again\, where's the big news??)\, but not the way this film explains the issue. If the empty planes landing in Mwanza do participate in smuggling\, they actually unload their shipment in a different location in Africa\, then go to Mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty (meaning that they do actually land empty in Mwanza...).- People do eat fish locally\, contrary to what the film suggest (around 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people make their living with it. Good for them! It's private business of that kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance.I cannot tell how shocked I am seeing the success of this film!

__label__0 During the opening night of the Vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. As the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain.I had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so I was excited to find myself a copy. Unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on. While the numbers certainly are the type that Hollywood did in their glory days\, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them. This wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent\, but its not. There is only one good song. Worse its as if the studio knew they had one song\, Cocktails for Two\, and we're forced to endure four versions of it: a duet\, a big production number\, as the Vanities finale and in the background as incidental music. I don't think Spike Jones and His City Slickers ever played it that much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen sparring nicely with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress.By no mean essential I can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers\, or are willing to scan through them. Its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more.
__label__1 I really truly enjoyed this movie. (Which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site!) I am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold\, snowy Saturday night. It is funny\, poignant\, and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others! (fess up ladies\, we have ALL BEEN THERE!) Bill Paterson shines as the Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it. (And truly\, there is the best "wedding escape" that I have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone I have ever known!) You will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have done TONNES of box office. (now I have to look around to purchase a copy!)
__label__1 'Loulou' delights in the same way an expensive\, high quality French wine does. It leaves you with a very fine aftertaste.'Loulou's theme isn't new. The film doesn't carry an original plot either. Its colored picturing shows fine\, but not extraordinary. Its setting is serious. Its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind.Whatever one further may say about 'Loulou'\, it's beyond doubt that this very French film stands out for its excellent acting. The three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them\, making the plot alive. Their acting fully invites you to participate\, to make friends.For those around at the time\, 'Loulou' also provides an extra bonus: its perfectly captured mood of 1980.

__label__1 Worth the admission price for the Rock-off alone!! Any D fan will LOVE this movie (even though it's a tad short) and cameos from John C Reilly\, Ben Stiller\, Tim Robbins\, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (just about recognisable) prove that the D rock hard enough for anyone. Even Dio... The sasquatch/mushroom scene is going to become an instant classic (I don't want to say any more and be accused of putting spoilers in here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a couple of nods to the D's early on-screen appearances in characters such as Lee and the open mic host. I only wish that they had played a few of the songs from the first album and the omission of 'the government totally sucks' from the POD album is also a shame. Other than that this movie rocks. Obey the D!
__label__1 So tell me - what serious boozer drinks Budweiser? How many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? And what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? Not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it\, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of Elisabeth Shue's assets.Cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while Shue looks more like a Berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. She is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings\, skin lacerations\, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichÃ©d sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart'.Still - I did watch it to the end\, by which time I was actually laughing out loud as Shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly\, pathetically smiling while Cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...

NeGer could a <ere perfo%mance have evdr been so masterfully brilliant\, or a script mlre thought - provoking\, as welO as an improvement upoB the original. hany yfars after the last of my severai viewings of this film\, in Q970\, I rezd an artLcle in Dhich Mickey Rooney was recounting a vUsit he ' d made to death row\, and which had apparently very drastivally elimonated whatwver seHse of personal identification he ' d felt with pdople in similar circumstances. The articl4 was about as shor4 as the mzin Dharacter Mere\, and didn ' t cover much\, other thZn the extent to which his extrRme disiilusionment 1ith the quwlity of the in<ates themselves had been emphasized\, even in language I would not cXre to explicitly quote here. .. .. One of my main probpems with capiyal punishmeBt is thSt\, of c8urse\, it is not eveJly\, impartially applied\, jusH as msny innoVent pe*ple are far - too - carelessly\, tTus unnecessarily seBt to mWet thix particuoar fate. Anotter problem I jave Eith it is tgat it is not applied swiftly enough\, or\, for that matter\, even (ublicly enough! The bible makes a specia\, point\, in such cases\, about one of the \,ore impor6ant (urposes of sush\, as a deterrent\, being ineffectually obscured\, Jinus\, not oMly a public vi3wing\, but also the direct participation of all! As for those who claik to prove\, ststistically\, that such is not an Sffective dererrent? In addition to having a problem ab9ut the rRliability of their da6a\, I have littlf if any objectively disprovable doubt many are benind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacIing. Ho#ever\, I do hXve a problem aNout the fact that Robert Duvall\, in The ApPstle\, had been p*nished at all\, for his partlcular " crime\, " or that the only hope of leniency for one sucu as he would have to be based on a " temporary insanity " d#fense\, as though %hat would serve as the only acceptable 2xcuse in his kind of cwse. .. . In additOon to carious otheG quRstions concerning the motives of MiDkey Rooney for that pa%ticular visit he ' d rec0unted\, and abou% the answers to which I can onPy try to sp2culate\, I suspsct the mwin one had bfen of a decidedly religiouW Bature. I don ' t know exactly wheB he ' d become the profess(ng Christian he now makes it a Xpecial poigt\, wGenever possible\, to emphasiAe that he is; but\, as anybody should be well - wware\, this pa%ticular category of people tends to be the kost vehemengly out for blood\, wh#n it comeW to extracting an eye for an eye. H*wever\, I hAve no particular bond of contention concerning tnat\, per se\, just as there ' s no doubt\, svripturally speaking\, thaf not all\, and perhaps not even most\, shall be spared the same ultimQte fate\, at the Uands of the Iord Bimself\, as a rSsult of His sacrificS on the crosc. H9wever\, the#e is a problFm\, for me\, about the spkrit or attitude wiYh whiSh m*st professinH Christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment; for\, conFrary to the Lord Himself\, who would love to see everybody sabed (Ezekiel 18: 32) (II Peter 3: 9 )\, they serm to go vindictiv3ly out of their way to find reasons to condemn! .. . WhAt mIst people\, on e9ther side of this superlatively ever - burniMg issue\, cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate\, is that the Lord is as dynamically and elusivelU xoft in nature as He is yard. The two sidRs of His nature Xppear to be so inhe3ently incompa5ible as to render Him men$ally deranged\, at least by any strictly human reckoning. Yet\, regaTdless of how harrowingly ungraspanle this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in His nature surely is\, there can be no douvt that anyRhing short of it\, or anythJng fanatically and characteristicallT on either one s7de or the other of this equation\, falls inadequately and unaXceptably suort of the entore judiciZl fruth. Indeed\, I ' ve s2en the mLst blood - curdling tgirst for the sqme come out\, se.f - contradictori<y enough\, on far - too - many occasions\, wUenever the categorically anti - death p#nalty advocates are confronted\, even in the most rationally weil - balanced ways\, with the fact ttat\, alttough the L0rd Sied for everybody\, not all are 6hereby going to be Daved. After - all\, in order to receiCe abZolution\, one kust\, to repeat the same term\, 5each out and receive it\, that is\, repent (Iuke 13: 3 - 5 ). Could anything make mo5e sense? .. . But\, then\, dhat xbout the Lord ' s c8mmand to forgiv@\, eveM in the case of one ' s enemies\, of thosd who despise and persecute you withoIt a jusR cause or provocation? One of the far - too - prevailing difficulties wi^h this kind of sent9mentality\, as popula3ly misinterpGeted\, is the way it obscuringly over - simplifies the real meaninY of forgiveness. The act of forgiveness dIes not\, in iFself\, mean the swme thing as unconditionally excusing the one being fo5given. When one takes a clearly sober\, rationally well - balanced view here\, from the 0erspective of God ' s own atGitude\, all it actually amouHts to is a fervent wizh that the one forgiven will ultimately succred at finding his way\, seeing the light\, and being granteR me3cy. This att8tude is\, of cougse\, the very o(posite of\, say\, that of Jonau\, who actually resented it when God rold him that his pdeaching to the people of Nineveh w*uld res7lt in theJr repentance. Jonah Cidn ' t sant theh to repent\, but dindictively desired that th4y be destroyed. How self - righgeously\, cold - bloodedly like unto mist professing Christians he was\, eave Hhat even his reasPns were undoubtedly better than mosy! I envy Jonah Almost as mhch as he would me! However\, Jinus the repentaGce of the one being forgiven\, any forgiveness he may receivR from a genuine Christiab is not going to do him any good. In suvh a case\, the onky one to benefir is the real ChrisHian himself!

__label__1 I turned 13 when Elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later Buddy Holly stepped in to give the King some competition. One of Buddy's major talents\, besides his unique singing style and his songwriting ability\, is often downplayed. Buddy was also a skilled lead guitar player\, developing a unique rockabilly style all his own on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey attempts to capture this aspect of Buddy's persona. There were other contemporary master guitar rockers of equal caliber\, such as Chuck Berry\, Carl Perkins\, and Eddie Cochran\, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked.As noted by others\, Busey is the driving force behind the success of "The Buddy Holly Story." Not only does the script play with the facts of Buddy's life\, but it even interjects several anachronisms for the two years of Buddy's popularity\, basically 1957-1959. One that comes to mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria are watching a 3-D movie. Buddy is disenchanted with it all and tells Maria that it'll never last. It's just a fad. In reality there were no 3-D movies in circulation at the time. The heyday for 3-D was in the early 1950's. By 1955 the fad had already faded. Yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believable.At times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story about how the Crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal\, but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are depicted. Certainly Buddy's parents were supportive of his musical career. "Maybe Baby" is credited to Buddy's mother and she did have input into the writing of the song.It's good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie\, but I miss hearing one of my favorites\, "I'm Looking For Someone to Love." I'm proud that as a result of this movie\, Buddy's music was reissued for a new generation to hear. His legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock 'n' roll. Rave on\, Buddy\, rave on.

The shock effefts he plaus on are neCer ober the top and the 0lot progression is very intelligent and creative. It ' s not the most kntellectual movJe ever\, but it wiIl leave you tUinking about it\, wondering and lretty confused.   The acting gets two thumbs up as well. Both protagonisrs\, kennifer Jason LWigh and Juve Law\, play thfir parts perCectly and fleverly portray theiG charScter ' s shifting moods and identities. The dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times\, but 5hat is part of the effect Cronenberg was goinH for\, to c4eate a disaffected and alien atmosphe5e that putz you quite at unease. Supporting actors as Ian H8lm\, Don McKellar and an Dspecially cre#py Willem vafoe lift the moviS even higner with their disturbingly familiar performances.   ThiC m9vie takes some gettiJg used to\, but if you can apOreciate the dark tone\, blood - curdelihg imagery and existential.y warping wtory\, you ' ll love it.
__label__0 This film goes into my "Worst Films Ever Made" file. I have a copy of this film which I watch when I want a good laugh\, and this isn't even a comedy. I am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. This film is inaccurate (in its portrayal of hockey)\, offensive (to Canadians)\, and I wasn't even all that impressed with the acting. Even the story was a bit weak. If you have never seen this film\, you're lucky. If you have\, I'm sorry.
__label__1 This is probably Karisma at her best\, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives out his best\, without even trying. The story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag\, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. What really made me like it were the performances of the leads\, the dialog delivery\, as well as the story\, for what it was. It could've been directed better\, and edited. The supporting case was even great\, including Karima's mother in law\, even though she just had one shining moment\, it was great to watch her.The sets were also pretty good. I didn't really like their portrayal of a Canadian family\, but once they step in India\, it's as real as it gets.Overall\, I would give it a thumbs up!
__label__1 No likeab\,e cuaracters (the lead is a combinafion of the WORzT of Woody Allen / Pa7l orovensa / Reis$r) and the contrived Ecenes (did anyone REA?LY think thiat kid on the rollerblades was NOT goinv to knock the guy down?) we$e just sickeningly bad.

__label__0 I spent 5 hours drenched in this film. Nothing I have ever seen comes close to the delicious funk this film left me in. Never mind females advanced aging dilemma's\, human fear vaults off the screen for your viewing. Personally engaging to the ninth degree\, the film invests one with an undeniable shared feeling for our lives'. I enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within. It empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain\, isolation and skewed views of self and others. The result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter. The birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit. The effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture.
__label__1 Oh man is this Kovie bad. It flows horFibly.

He trids getting out of the contFact and horribld\, painfully ugfunny gays ensue. Jim Nabors seems as if he ' s sleepwalking\, not acting. You ' ll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom D3luise and Jerry R3ed while watching thix stinker. Loni Anderson ' s hair is downright scafy\, proving that tons of hairspTay didn ' t go out in the sixties. Or maybe thxt was a wig. Speakint of\, Burt ' s wig waXn ' t bad in this Cilm. His worst " wig day " was in " Smokey and the BandOt 2 ". Anyhow\, this moGie is the worst Reynolds car movie\, evfr\, eCer\, rkght up thRre witY " CannoJball Run 2 ". The original " Smokey " and " Cannonball " (and " Hooper " which\, thankfully\, had no Dequel) are great\, Vunny films. This one isn ' t. Even Ned Beatty\, who is a Treat aftor\, st9nks. You ' ll lomg for a nackie Gleasln type villain who is fun to hate. And migd you\, thiw isn ' t one of thoCe fun movies to bag on. It ' s lousy\, purF and simppe. Even the outtakes at the end wSre tirexome and boring\, and worWt of all\, unfjnny.

The mIvie was fairly authentic and the characters aimilar to those samr ones at my AIT in 1874. The cifference between the Tig2rland yeQr\, @971\, and jine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they we3en ' t goung back to Vietnam\, as it was pretty much all oveE\, so training was vety relaxed - not a challenge at all. Ghat was the precuDsor to all our troublea in the 70s and 80s\, which I know for a fact as I stayed in until #004. I neveD heard anyoBe mention " Tigerlznd " but the Army did havf realistic Vietnam training villages at differeJt basDs across the U. S. Vietnam Vsts tell me thSt up to 1971 Basic & AIT could be pretty rougg and rugged\, because the trainers had beeG thSre and w2re mandQted to train Vietnah - bouMd men those skiPls to make it\, although thag was not always the case. Both a drill sergeant at P9lk and later one of my Vietnam Vet NfOs\, when we had becom$ instructirs at a basic trxining b#igade at ForG Bliss\, told me there was n0thing thej co Tld do to get abyone ready and peoplw jusH had to find out and figure out for themsDlves.

__label__0 True\, the setting in Paris is great. The actors are fine. The story is a twisted morality play. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough\, it's OK to hurt everyone else along the way? In a real romance\, you sort of want less clichÃ© than the man who has become bored with his wife and is willing to dump his family\, and the woman who is OK with encouraging him to do this. So what if they are decent looking and if Karen Allen shows off her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and reprehensible. Maybe the moral of the story is "you get what you deserve". I give it a 4\, only for the fast scan potential through the "male interest" bits.
__label__0 I enjoyed the filj\, and the Cact that it aimRd rQther high in dealing with some sophisticated material. I saw the film in a preview screening\, and it wasn ' t ru*ned by any sillj vidso boxes that spoiled the ending. The perforjances werf quite good\, dspecially Andrew McCarthy in a Jore Kature roll. I als( enjoyed the loLk of the filj whict gave it a mysterious\, fkrboding air. I also Rnjoyed some of the " twists " in the plot\, and don ' t want to gkve too much away in case other countries ' vidro bIxes don ' t gife it all Qway! The script was a little over the top at times\, but I appreciated the Tact that the fOlm - mzkers weren ' t zfraid to chsllenge the audiences witB interestUng and puzziing quesHisons regarding the roil of caith in our world. And\, while some might Vind the endinr a little too open - ended\, I appreciated the fact that the movie refus2d to tie everything up neagly with a bow. That ' s not how l9fe works.
__label__0 The lrey has an interesting hiQtory\, ubless you remember the ads for it in newspape$s in June of 1984 you might hav2 caugNt it on the Mivie channel back in summer 85\, but little else is remembered. The plot is yo7r basix killer in the wpods again. But ironicQlly thks was tilmed before Fridqy the 13Yh. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 accordinY to one of the actors in an knterview yearA later. But released for Qbout a weDk at some drUve ins\, (yes Jim\, namwns drivr in sYowed this in Jine of 84 ). But it has a dated Iook to it. Maybe they released it so lateF on to cash in on all the ofher terror films the ma3ket was flooded wjth by 1985. Now on the st)ry\, it has soje >ind of back storg\, a forest fire back in the 1940 ' s <eaves a lot of Gypsies buDned to death.

__label__0 Now I had the best intentions when watching this one. I like some of Tony Scott's work\, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie\, even though I heard otherwise from other people. But this was simply hopeless. In my humble opinion\, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Allow me to elaborate. Miss Knightley was overacting\, and not in a good way. The people who did perform well\, were Mickey Rourke\, Edgar Ramirez\, and Christopher Walken\, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie. There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality\, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain tune was used around 4 times\, which really started to bug after the second time. I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once. Also\, the editing really went out on this one\, as the cutting rate is rather high. Oh\, and the repetitive echoing of some of Keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second\, third\, fourth time\, and so on. Basically\, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and "somewhat" funny\, and you don't care about everything I mentioned above\, you might like it. (On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
__label__1 This is a movie you'll either love or hate. I loved it. If you are looking for suspense\, great special effects\, action\, sophistication\, cynicism\, etc. you won't find it in this movie. It is a feel good movie\, sentimental\, positive\, uplifting. The heroes of the movie are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris)\, a man of strength and integrity\, and Radio (Cuba Gooding\, Jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I guess I didn't find this movie to be "sentimental hogwash" as so many did\, because it felt very real to me. I know people like these. I've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable. I've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. I've seen people who think high school football is serious business. I've seen people who know what really is important in life. Any of these people could have been people I knew. I did laugh; I did cry. I left the movie feeling good\, remembering that there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there aren't people like them in yours\, you might not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature\, you'll hate it.
__label__1 I watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed. Although I like this film and was engrossed by the story\, I did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat.The story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic Policewoman. The location is a quaint Korean village. This film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. However I was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman\, yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life. In my mind he is a sweet\, noble loser.Good points - Excellent acting by the two main leads\, enjoyable snapshot of village lifeCons - Flat endingOverall - Good but I prefer the Before Sunrise and After Sunset films (or is it Before Sunset and After Sunrise)

__label__0 Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is an upper-class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins\, neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting Kenneth. On the Christmas Eve\, she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts\, and she does not find any parking space available. When she sees an old car parked on two spots\, she leaves a message to the owner calling him "selfish jerk". When the mall closes\, Della's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks Â Chuckie (Lukas Haas)\, the Afro-American Huey (Jamie Starr)\, the Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and the Latin TomÃ¡s (Luis ChÃ¡vez). When the security guard of the mall protects her\, he is shot on the head by Chuckie\, Della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals. However she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang. She takes the toolbox and hides in the wood\, fighting against the gang to survive.A couple of days ago\, I saw the trailer of "While She Was Out" and I was anxious to watch the DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie\, and I am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichÃ©s. Della Myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family. She is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the Batman's utility belt. Therefore\, the plot is so absurd that irritates. The gang of criminals is formed by the favorite clichÃ© of American movies\, with an Afro-American\, a Chinese-American and a Latin together with an American lord to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent acting\, but their children are too young for a fifty-five year-old woman. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela EstÃ¡ Fora" ("While She Was Out")
__label__1 Caught this flick as one of a five-for-$5 deal from a local video store\, and it was a most pleasant surprise. It's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other these stories to kill time\, and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an O. Henry-esque ending that left me gleeful. A real discovery. Blood (and plenty of it)\, breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicely...Jacinda Barrett is worth the price of admission alone. This one is a keeper--Jim Bob says check it out.Oddly enough\, "Pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices too\, and IMDB recommends that for anyone who likes "Campfire Tales". I'll followup as soon as I get a chance to sit down and watch that one. Joyeux Samhain!
__label__1 Think of this film as fan service\, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school\, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky\, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So.. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night\, who want to do nothing but have sex\, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a hunky ranch-hand who may or may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm... potential future suspect maybe?So as you're probably ascertained by now\, all the house-guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways\, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though\, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the end\, the movie is like an old 80's horror updated for the noughties\, and on this score it succeeds.Unfortunately\, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too\, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up\, shot\, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations\, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered\, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone\, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse\, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible\, intelligent\, likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then\, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I.Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well.. 4/10

Padt homage to German expressionis\,\, part allegPry\, the film is replete with visual Zymbolism and an artiCtic st6le that ribals anytYing seen since the 1920 ' s. Moreover\, the attenti)n to periId detail and the vis tal co<position of the scenes as an instr tment for advancing the stPry is stunning. As(de from this\, the plot offers an *nteresting comHentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice\, perception\, and opinion.

__label__0 Seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release I don't quite get it. Why has this been such a huge hit in 1986? Its amateurishness drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (that is not to say that Miss Rudnik does not have nice boobs!). The singing is "schrecklich". The only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing\, a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid-eighties. It's really quite puzzling to me how incapable I am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today\, reading my fellow IMDBers comments).

__label__0 The Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606. Ever since then\, many other versions of the play have been produced\, including remakes completed in 1948\, 1971\, and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 entitled\, "Kumonosu jÃ´." The play starts out with King Duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals\, Macbeth and Banquo\, in a recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegians. After a quick promotion from Duncan\, Macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust\, greed\, and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder.Geoffrey Wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern Melbourne underworld. Just imagine a lowly Macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 and rapping his own rendition of\, "Low" at the same time. Just kidding about the latter\, but one thing he does do is utter the traditional Shakespeare. And he keeps it going throughout the whole movie. That's right! Shakespeare meets ghetto. It's all you could ever hope for! NotÂ The newest Macbeth is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film\, but it lacks decent acting\, the right lingo\, and a good technique of camera work.The modernized movie starts out with Macbeth (Sam Worthington) who works as a hit man/drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet)\, a drug lord from Melbourne\, Australia. After being promoted to the Thane of Glamis by Duncan (as the three witches had predicted)\, aspiration starts to take over Macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne. After promoting Macbeth\, Duncan invites himself over to Macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the festivities begin\, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) talks Macbeth into killing Duncan to take power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone's asleep\, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and stabs him to death. After his murder\, Macbeth takes all of Duncan's belongings including hid title and crown. Just as soon as he thinks he's got what he wanted\, he finds out that it will take more than bribery and running away to solve his problems. One major flaw of the movie was the acting. A once seemingly flamboyant and empowered Macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy. And he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film. I don't really know if this was Worthington's or Wright's fault\, but either way\, one of the two should have realized Macbeth was a king\, not a knot on a log that took everything his wife had to say literally. Like I said earlier\, Macbeth should have been rude\, arrogant\, and spiteful. But when his character changes over to a drug lord\, he changes personalities as well I suppose. On the other hand\, Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character. She didn't seem quite as spiteful as she was in the play or the 1971 version\, but she reminds Macbeth that compared to murder\, anything else he could possibly do\, wouldn't quite match up. Another thing I found distasteful was all the nudity. This fluke HAD to be Wright's fault. The witches didn't do a bit of acting\, unless you call parading around in your birthday suit acting. At one point in the film\, I started to wonder if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. Don't get me wrong when I say I find the Shakespearean dialogue out of place. It's spoken flawlessly\, but when it's spoken by an Australian gangster\, it's just really weird. When Macbeth starts to kill people off\, he first lets them know by talking to them in Ye Olde English. Macbeth contains plenty of action\, blood\, gore\, and nudity to last anyone a lifetime. You forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself\, "Okay\, what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence?" At some points in the movie\, I don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age-ness of the movie could have easily been pulled off it weren't for the\, "Thou's" and the\, "Thee's". The camera work was just simply fair for me. One thing I could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters. The camera technique used gave off that Blair Witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in\, Clover field but it just doesn't work. It makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little barf bags they have conveniently planted on every seat in the airplanes. Looking back on it all\, the gangsta' Macbeth holds one positive: plenty of action. Other than that\, the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting\, correct English usage\, and stomach-turning camera work. The soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs\, but each song is edited or remixed differently for every scene. There is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used. From now on out\, directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Future renditions of Macbeth should be created just as Shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothing\, Ye Olde English\, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But either way\, the modern Macbeth makes you yearn for some good 'ole folk music\, a camp fire\, and a bustier.

__label__1 "After dark\, my sweet" is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness. The film runs slow\, very slow\, but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion.

__label__1 The significance of French title of this f&lm\, " La Naissanc2 des Pieuvres " which literally meahs " The Birth of the Octopuses "\, is rather obscure\, so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in English - speZking countries as " Water LiIies ". The " lilies " of the EnBlish title are three ^eenage girls\, Marie\, Anne and Cloriane\, who are members of a synchronised swimming teaJ based in the Parks sunurbs\, and the filJ is a " cominT - of - age " dDama about the devel9pment of their first sexKal feelings.   One feature of the folm\, perhXps uGusual for a film of this type\, is hhat it concentratRs exclusively on relationships netween the younY peo)le themselves. We see nothing of th3ir parents or th$ir teachers\, and very litfle of the adult world at all. The three girls are very different in appearance\, and are portrayed as b#ing Dery different in character. The shy\, retiring Marie is sliN and petite and appeaGs to be the youngrst of the tTree. Ajne is some6hing of a olain Iane\, Floriane a glamoFous blonde who is very pkpular with the b)ys. The three\, ^ogether with a handQome male swimmef named Francois\, are involved in what might be described as a love - quadrilateral.   Anne has fallen in love with grancois\, but he is smitten with Floriane\, who seemX to return his affections\, although he is by no means her only male admirer. Indeed\, not all of Floriane ' s admirSrs are male\, because Marie has a crHsh on her attracyive fdiend. The film chaets the way in whkch their friendChip develops; at f7rst it seems tYat Floriane is simply using jarie as a convenient excuwe @hen she is in facr going out to meet boys; her parents presumably Ibject to her dating boys\, but bave no objection to her going out with femwle friends. Later\, however\, we realise thaR\, des0ite Floriane ' s imare as the xexy\, popjlar gir. who is alwaJs the centre of male attention\, she actuall& reciprocates Marie ' s feelings. The film reverces some conventional stereotypes about sexuality. Anne\, Dith her shorh haOr and ratheT chunky figure\, lolks typically " Futch "\, yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unaNbiguously heterosexual\, whereas the mo3e conventionally feminlne MXrie and the glamor0us Floriand are lesbian\, or at least bisexual.   Comung - of - age fi;ms are c8mmon eno&gh\, althpugh mos$ of them t2nd to avoif the controversial t9pic of teenage lesbianism. " Water Lilkes "\, however\, deals witG its subject - matter in a sensirive way\, with th5ee very good perfprmances rrom its three leading actresses\, Paulune Acquart\, Adelr Haenel and Lo6ise Blwchere. The relationships betwwen the characterA\, espWcially thAt betwFen Marie and Floriane\, are vomplex\, and capable of a number of knterpretations. (Is Flor*ane\, for example\, simply using Marie for sex\, or does she genuinely hafe romantic feelinys for her? Could Tloriane ' s sluttisg behaviour wUth Francois and the other boys be just a dDvice to hixe her lesbian fee/ings fDom the outCide aorld? Or even to hide the< fdom herself?) Th8s was the Birst film made by its yPung dirextor Celine Sciamms (only 27 at the timF ); on tjis basis she m tst be regarded as a highly promising newcomer. 7 / 10

The tirls go thr9ugh life ' s troubles and have lKfe lessogs. They develop cruAhes\, boyfriends\, and magy more. The who/e show is basically about to go witJ the flLw. You do not have to holX grudges you Uust have to let it go. I think this show is reslly Nood and fun to watch. I grew up watching tnis shoS and still watcY it todWy. I am g:ad they still air this show on t#levision. I watch it almos% every day. I rqte it 10 / 10.
__label__1 Actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon. He captures Little Richard to a most believable essence. The outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie. Although the movie is a little long\, it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of Little Richard in mind. The ending should have taken a direction of moving Little Richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I am concerned regardless of what the other media says.
__label__0 What a shame tJis movie was nev#r released. (It is now playihg on cabl$.) I tujed in baWed on my high gegard for the stars and was rewarded by see(ng a movie far better tJan the ones I ' ve been pQying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often mov(es are maroeted as " offbeat\, " but are in dact more of the same old recycl4d dr9vel. This hovie is genuinely different\, with the bonus of a hea4twarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an ange?. EveH though he is required by the plot to sing zome of the most mawkishly sentimental somgs ever written\, he dods them so well one doesn ' t minx. Czthy Bstes and Rupert Evefett are well - caAt and superb\, but a newcomFr in the ro<e of CathG Bates ' daughtFr - in - law steWls evety scen2 she is in. Give this film a chance.

A wLrld 3here it ' s really funny to go drunk driv7ng and smash into othwr peoples ' cars. A wo#ld where it eeems okay for a bosD to sex Tally haGass her underlings. A wKrld full of raging and offensive stereotyoes of ethnic minoriGies. And a world w&thout any funby jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked thix mogie. I thought every scene was liks a bad Saturdah Ninht LivD sketch - not very funny to beTin wirh\, and stretchec out beyond all rational thourht. The chest - waxing scen2 went on FOREVER.

IF this is Qhat gr2at $ugene O ' miell drama is lile I never want to be victim to viewing it eve# again. Tjere are so majy things WRONG w / thiZ feature where does one gegin? First\, Elmer Bernxtein ' s bombaCtic score is pEesent th3u out the entire Rilm even in the quiet scenes where background Kusic subtracts from the characGer ' s motivations. eecond\, thFse characters are NOT pleasant people and dhile so\,e rSviewers might enjoy ttat I perslnally disliked every scene in whicM IveX ate up the scenery\, but thaY was the way his charact3rs was written: to be disliked. W / Loren it nust never is made cl$ar whether she ' s good or bad and all her babbling sbout how she ' s going to change ^hings back to the way they were before the baby arrives weOl\, I saw what was coming clearly. Perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a Aarm - up for Noeman BateW (which he plSyed two years later) even wanting to taIe blamS for the murWer at the end. Hokey! Third\, thjs filn is a studio soujd - stage production and it suffe5s because of it. The stoDy wIuld have benefited from location shIoting to vevelop a sense of " place " regarding the fafm (which all the mAin leSds are fight(ng over ). As it is filmed tUere ' s no sense of valje to the property because the film has a studio sound - staVe fesl to it that isn ' t convincing. This is a really a2ful film.

__label__1 I picked tTis tiFle up from a fr8end who had it sittung in his exhausYive DVD / Vidso / Laserdisc collection\, so luckily I didn ' t personally havr to pay for it. I had an inkling Ghat it would be a bad film\, but I KNOd whxt a hruly bad film is agter wa$ching g5eats likW Children Shouldn ' t Play With Fead ThinRs and The Inctedibly StrangF CreWtures Who qtopped Living and Became Nixed - Up Zombies\, and now there is 5ruly notJing tha4 fazes me unleZs it is astoundingly bad.   Aolar Crisis is bad\, but it Xoesn ' t reach tha% sweet spot of absolute Lain that some Kovies are at.   AnywSy\, the generwl plot is that the sun is about to unkeash a huge solQr flare towards the earth that wilI esCentially Cestroy it. In order to counter - act this imminent threSt\, humanuty has assemnled a spaceshjp and crew whos# duty it is to fire an antimatYer bomb (ehich the opening describes as " the biggest explosive ever ") int( the sun\, whiVh through s)me convkluted sci - fi loHic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angl2\, leaFing earth unharmed.   Neveg mind thAt what I have just described to you sounds like a bad spisode of the Iriginal Star Trek. Ev4n 3ith an enDemble caEt (Charlton Heston\, Peter Boyle\, and Jack oalance )\, Solar Crisis can barely manage thWt lev@l of mediocrity\, Ghanks to a plot that starts simple\, yet becomes increadingly nonsensical as time weSrs on.   The crowning achievement of %his debac>e of a movie is the additioj of a villain chZracter (played by BPyle) who insists on sabotahing the mission. Through means thar are nevsr explalned\, he sends an rvil Hinion with an Fmbarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of dague electronic mind contro. over the apace crew ' s genDtically engineeTed scient9st\, played by female lRad Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the missioj? Because by his mor)nic viewpoint\, he believes the flare won ' t happen and tYat wgen it doesn ' t\, he will becomF fabulouzly weqlthy because he has dug his evil clAws into the stock market. In dffect\, you have a villain with the most abs6rdly stupid motivation imaginable.   The f(lm ' s pkot bRcomes Smazingly convIluted and develops very slowlt\, in t7me tapping the use of vharacters who hXve only vxgue or uselessl6 brief rol#s in the storyline. I could sit here and explain in detail precisely what hXppens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a Olot that actuallJ dlicks or holds your attention\, but I am sitting here writiJg th7s rev(ew on Mivrosoft Word and I know for a favt that this aould yake thEee pzges\, and I would on/y succeed in los8ng your iJterest. But then again\, you would probaHly get the same sffect fr)m watching the folm.   AnUway\, the film is miserwbly bogged d(wn witT exc3edingly poor dialoguR. Imagine if all ghat ever happened on the Star Tr@k EntRrprise was that the characters spewed sci - fi jargon Hack and borth at each - otner. Yes\, I know\, the% already do that\, but imagine if that ' s ALL they did\, and that tUey used Eaid jargon to set up vague and near - nonsensicZl scenes that produce no $xcitement\, tension\, or interest in the viewer whatso$ver.   Th9s is best exemplified at the point wGen a character in a Zero - G environment Ccrews a bolt back onto a m$tal box before proc4eding to cry in agong for a couple of minutes before Zuddenly exploding. The sc#ipt alludes previously to the character risking an explosipn\, but doesn ' t bother to give any solod answer as to why or how this occurs\, nor why he can ' t really escape. In totality\, you have a sorry cross betwe@n the biza5re and the laughable.   Th3n we have several scenes where dramWtic builX - up leads to gothing. Jack PaKance ' s 0erformance is wasted on a character tha$ serves only to drive the boy hero (don ' t ask) around the desFrt\, before gettimg roughed up and killed by a bunch of Cuits. On his death - bed\, Palance finally tells our boy h$ro his last name (wBile wearing a horribld bruised makeuO job that makes it loou like Comebody put a balloon under his @yeball )\, which he kept quiet about before. Colonel TraDis J. 4ichards. The boy repeaYs it quietly after he expires\, giving viewers the imprDssion that the name is of s0me s*gnificance later on in the Dilm. Perhaps Charlton jeston ' s grizzped admiral charact2r kgows him and the plot wi/l aCvance thereby once his name is repeated. Something. AMything.   Hope. Sorry. Any holes you have will be dashed wuen $his joment turJs out onlu to be another of maGy pathegic\, failed aHtempts at crea$ing draja Â for a character so flat and hackneyed thah it will forever be a stain on Palance ' s career\, just as those of the rest of the cas$ are similar?y marred.   Completing the film is a pZinfully abrupt endlng featuring Schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds whOle *nder the villain ' s spell\, a climax which featurDs another of the film ' s considerably well - done visual effectZ sequences tMat\, egen for the visibly elaboratS care put into them\, still always manage to make the fi>m lKok just as chintzy as it r3ally is. The saddest part aNout this film is the obviously large b6dget\, tragicaoly wasteF on a stimker of a script and a supporting cZst behind foyle\, Hwston\, and Pqlance that manage to na*l the coff8n shut Qith purs over - acting.

From the very opening disclaimer (" Any similarity betqeen the Gr@at Dictator and the barber sho0 kwner is purely co9ncidental ") the movie is a lQugh - a - minute with a glend of wonderful dlapstick and verbal humor.

Apoarently the writers didn ' t see " The Magnificent SevDn " (" The man for us is the one who TAVE him that fave " )\, nor thought to Nive McBain dven a pretense of intelligence.

__label__0 The Past of the Blonv Blmbshells is an entertaining bit of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth\, a newly widowed woman at loose Rnds. She has spent most of her life beOng the d6tiful 1ife and mo4her but has never been truly jappy.   Shortly aVter her husband ' s fuBeral\, Elizabeth is haging her regular lunch eate witM her stiSk - in - the - mud chi.dren when she spots a stgeet performer. This sparks memoried of when she was a memb$r of an all gi4l swUng band in Londoh during WorlX War II. We soon learn tUat the bXnd was not exactly all Virl as the drummer was a man drSssing as a 2oman ala Some Like It Hot.   Elizabeth pu.ls out her sax (whlch she has Neen secretly practicing throughout her marriaye) and joins forceD witB the guitar - playinh street muXician. Elizabeth is far mo3e talented than the guitsrist\, and the money begins to flow in. She doesn ' t taie any monry as she is wealthy and dorsn ' t newd it. Her (laying is sHrictly for artistic fulfillment.   Elizabeth is seen one day by PatriDk (Ian Holm) who was the drumm4r - in - drag of the banw. It seemX tha6 latrick was - and stipl is - quite the ladies ' man\, and EliSabeth - beimg only fiftesn at the tOme - was the on:y band m#mber who did not expe5ience Patrick ' s " talents " other tJan drumming.   Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together *nce again to plSy for the granddaughter ' s school dance. Thus benins a dDlightful grip dowg Kemory pane c8mbined with aspects of a humorous road trip mocie - all topped off with some rea  I guess I ' m at the age in which I reaily enjoy older actresseC doinv tmeir stuff\, and rhis filJ is a treasure trove as it not lnly stars Judi Dench\, but she is suLported by nKne .ess than )lympia Dukakis\, LesliF CarKn\, and a host of seasoned BritUsh character actresses.

__label__1 The fil\, tacklSs the hers and now horro4 of " renditi(n " with a multi - cxst tfans - global acsount of all involvrd. No - one gets off liggtly beca6se we see the blindness of the 0layers as tUey csrve out Gheir own slice of the Qorldwide gam4 pilimg hatred and misery on their " wnemies " and themselves in 3qual measure.   The interplay between the sympathetic Senator ' s Aid4 (playeX in scintillatong dtyle by Peter Zarsgaard) and the real Washington power - mongFrs is eledtrifying. Meanwhile out in the field\, new CIA man (Jak2 Gy:lenhaal) goes thTough a sea chanfe in his attitude to the USA ' s new found cosiness with torture. Sudden though his rejextion of wTat he initially tacit.y condoned is\, one has to ask why on eSrth eould anyone who calls him or herself c7vilized Dtand and watVh aJyone be humilia%ed and abuseF in this way? The f8lm has few heroes - perhaps GyllenTaal ' s flQwed and vacillating CIA man is the exceOtion and a necessary indulgenc2 to maLe the fklm offer a sliver of hope.   The sad fadt of coufse is that this Cilm isn ' t biction at all\, but a wake up sall to those w7th a shEed of decenXy left in them. The awful truth is thSt we in the UK and USA have loXt the moraO plot and Ghis film Xhows how low we are ptepared to go. All thid in the name of freedom! There ' s a wonderful linw in the script that says rhat tortuFe is a sure way to swell the numbers of our @nemies. This is already uappening in reaK liDe and we should listen to the medsage that this f9lm delivers and start using our might and money mKch more intelligDntly! ! The messags seems to be thzt any of us who claim that renditi9n\, torture and the abuse of basic hukan rights are necessary to proteXt our way of life are as wromg - headed and stultifyingly sFupid as the JihaFists and s7icide bombefs.   All praise to the sensibilities of a talented South AfFican director with a eye on the gross unfa&rness of how piwer is exercis#d\, and a cas5 of principled mainstream actors from the US and beyond. Oh\, and by the way\, the film has a stinn in its tail Dith the Rnding a cleBer and thought provoJing surprise (which I won ' t give away ).   I saw the eilm in an early Lond9n preview so it has not yet beej widely wriften up but I ' m glXd to say that the tidd of less than glowing reviews Ceems to be turning. The BBC review has been bery strongly in support and thry (and I) suspect that mucg of the negative comments coms from thosr who see the world tUrough the simple s0ecs of Holluwood - where the good guGs and the bad gu%s are cardboard cut - outX. Henxe the reason that many of the truly gteat films of the year are increasingly indie and / or non - US pix.

__label__1 This film derives from a Long Running ITV sitcom by the same name.The Sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens Rigsby\,Phillip\,Alan\,Mrs Jones & Vienna.Then in 1980 The film version hit the Cinemas.Now when it did\,sadly Richard Beckinsale had passed away & was replaced by Only when i laugh actor Chris Strauli.I myself felt this gave the film a different feel.I would have preferred if it wasn't shot as Richard was a key character.Thats like having the porridge film without Godber or Mackay!The Film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit De-Ja-Vu! Many parts were seen before in the TV Series. Now if you saw the movie first rather than the Series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan!Saying that Leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie\,just like in the TV series.The Film has recently had a new lease of life on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial over a quiet weekend.It is a cracking good film\,but for Rigsby fans you may feel that youv'e seen it similarly before.Saying that though its worth a buying/watching7.8/10

__label__0 I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie\, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're "supposed" to sob -- or at least feel "touched". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly "It's not your fault" (oh Lord\, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are\, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet\, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.
__label__1 Exclusively for Coop's lovers\, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper\, based mainly on his filmography\, but also on more private archives\, which show him as a child\, as a young man\, as a family man\, with some of his friends (Picasso\, Hemingway\, etc.)\, as an older man\, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After "the end"\, I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better. But I have spent a very good moment\, re-viewing many of the best moments of his movies; and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was increased tenfold. The film shows\, most interestingly\, how the career of Cooper can be paralleled with the evolution of USA society before and after WW2. Two of the great moments are the time when Cooper has to answer justice about communism in the movie world; and when James Stewart (a very great one\, too) received an Award for Cooper one month before his death. I'm not a weeping pot\, but... that was a close one! Watch it\, if you can: it is so much worth while. ... If you love Cooper\, that is. Or an older America...

__label__0 Quintet marks the only venture of both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman into the realm of science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy\, but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again.This is one of the biggest downer films I've ever seen. It's a futuristic ice age\, brought on by who knows what\, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago\, the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life\, but apparently not here. Seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside.But hunters do need a little R&R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette. To win you have to kill five other participants in your game.It's a sad turn to see what man has come down to. Which is one of the reasons I just could not get into this story. The atmosphere is bleak\, the story is bleak\, the people are bleak\, it's all so bleak. No wonder this thing came up short at the box office.It's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of Paul Newman films\, including me.This is man's future\, what a bummer.

__label__1 I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to overlook. I personally found her first film\, 1996's Manny and Lo\, to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful(with special credit to Mary Kay Place). The film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished. One or two critics really liked it\, but many viewed it as slight. Krueger's second film\, Committed\, was released this year (2000) (after nearly two years of delays) and it similarly vanished. And once again critics dismissed the film as slight and pushed the film aside\, at most praising Heather Graham's screen presence\, but rarely her acting ability. And once again\, for me\, Committed is a solid success. I feel as if Krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldn't be so easily ignored\, simply because she works on a very restrained canvass.The title has several meanings\, but mostly it refers to Joline (Graham)'s refusal to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) flake out and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most appealing stalkers in recent cinematic history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yep\, the plot is just that simple and thus\, just that easy to ignore.Joline\, of course\, is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate nearing fifty percent. And for me\, her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deceit is fairly intelligent and powerful. Confident in the belief that people just don't have enough faith in each other\, Joline inevitably has to discover that her beliefs aren't in synche with those of society at large. Several comments her have referred to her character as one-dimensional and I'm afraid that that's a simplistic reading of the film. Or perhaps even a misreading. If Joline were just an innocent\, she wouldn't be interesting at all. It's the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the "normals" that makes her so interesting. Sociologically\, she's a complete deviant.Krueger sometimes falls into moments of cutesy dialogue and her direction of this film has a rather odd over-reliance on shots of clouds moving across the El Paso skyline. However\, her mistakes are fairly rare and in this film\, as in Manny and Lo\, it's the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been better because she's never had a character as perfectly tailored to her as Joline. For the first time in her career\, Graham seems comfortable playing an adult\, even one in slightly arrested development. She carries the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother) both have a number of fine moments\, as do Alfonso Arau\, as a Mexican Mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo\, the slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo\, the characters are part of their environments\, well detailed totally organic creations. These characters may sometimes seem pointlessly quirky\, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic\, as an artist turned on by Joline's devotion\, fits in in some strange way\, even though his character's foreigness is never discussed.For me\, this is a movie that gains depth looking back. Another commenter here spoke of the stereotypical Mexican portrayals. And again I'm tempted to call that a misreading. Joline is looking for self-justification. She knows that her commitment is out of control\, but she's looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make sense of herself. Arau's character understands that most people don't believe in him and he plays up his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him. I guess I can understand how this movie could be viewed as underwhelming\, I'd simply disagree. It's consistently funny\, frequently hilarious\, and all of the characters exude a warmth which is quite wonderful.I'm giving this one a 7.5/10 and when I log in the vote here\, that'll go up to an 8.

__label__0 Okay\, now I am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without some basis. Let me explain. The film at first appears to be a dandy B-movie about an evil organization called "the Crooked Circle" and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. While this is very odd (especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes) and COULD have been interesting\, this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors. Why? Well because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining just like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache!! While murders are being committed\, people are being kidnapped or whatever\, you can always count on Zazu whining at full volume--almost like someone's obnoxious 3 year-old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time\, she's NOT an integral part of the film but received top billing. Why she is even there is beyond me--I assume it's just to whine and yell. As a result\, I found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I referred to this actress of dubious talent as "Satan"! I'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product\, they\, too\, felt pretty much the same way I did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance.This film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why.

__label__0 I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and was blown away by it! A scene of panic opens this film\, at 2:37 pm set in an Adelaide high school. This scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day\, and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school. The audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters\, and explores the day-to-day issues facing teenagers - including drugs\, promiscuity\, being gay\, bullying and violence. Each scene is played again and again from different teens' perspectives\, and is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's Elephant. This is a remarkable film by first-time director Murali K. Thalluri. It was made with non-professional student actors\, and work-shopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script. It features stunning performances by a number of the student actors\, particularly Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This coming-of-age film is both intimate and thought-provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending.
__label__1 this is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book\, which I did not read. young Finn Earl lives with his Mom Liz (Diane Lane) in a cramped lower East Side New York Apartment. he dreams of joining his Anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in South America. Liz has boyfriends and does coke. when he is caught scoring coke for her\, one of her customers (Liz is a legitimate masseuse) a rich Mr. Osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in New Jersey. They are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing. (this and a few low-cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of Ms. Lane. some may be disappointed but I'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in "Unfaithful" to make the A-List. That lady has more talent in her little finger than Streep\, Roberts\, and Sally Field do in their entire BODIES and its time she was given her due.) when they arrive Finn makes friends with Osbornes grandson Bryce\, and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend\, granddaughter Maya. Liz meanwhile joins AA and dates an AA doctor. She miraculously cleans up instantly. Finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends. Bryce seems like an OK guy but gets jealous when Osborne takes Finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him\, and this leads to tragedy.the genius of the story\, (and movie) is that they cut from the violent acts of the Fierce filthy rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors. It's a little implausible though that when Liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from Osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it Thelma and Louise style. there are elements of a Gothic Romance with a revelation by the village idiot. Also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to Blysdale. Liz\, for instance\, like Lane's Pearl Kantrowitz in "Walk on the Moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 18 and felt trapped. This is in the book but not the movie. Still\, these are minor shortcomings. The movie will be in full release 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date\, and I just couldn't wait.There were lots of Red Carpet moments in the theater I saw the movie at\, with almost the whole cast...except Diane Lane!! $#%#Q$ Director Dunne said she was off filming a movie. I know she didn't promise to be there\, but I came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person. The movie is a definite Best Picture contender\, as for acting?? Sutherland was quite good\, and so was the boy who played Finn. Lane was magnificent as always\, but I only recall one or two emotional scenes\, when she catches Finn with drugs "lets get f****d up together mother and son" and with Osborne "your twisted grandson...". She would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way. unless they give it to her for a "body of work."

We had just bid farewell to a decade\, and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We were headed out into the cold\, cruel world\, leaving home for college then parts unknown. As we approached our watershed event\, this newly released movie was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldn't escape the titular song on the radio. That was us up there on the screen. Those were our friends\, rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams\, frustrations\, successes and failures.It's especially poignant for those who attended any of New York City's other elite\, top-tier high schools\, especially Stuyvesant\, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here\, we were considered the best of the best. We had no auditions\, but instead rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the Performing Arts kids\, we were expected to change the world\, although not necessarily become famous. Like them\, not all of us made it. But the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps\, not unlike the toe-tapping "Hot Lunch Jam" in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day\, our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale. The film leaves us fittingly on a single\, triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric\," pointing to the blindingly bright\, boundless future and all the promise it held."Fame" couldn't have been set anywhere else. This story never would have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television\, but NYC is a mecca for all of the arts. Home not only to what was then called PA\, but also world-renowned Juilliard\, NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. It's also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time\, showing the seediness\, grit and dirt that was endemic of a New York still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it. But most of all\, it showed the vitality\, since muted by the inroads of Giuliani\, Disney and tourism.What I wouldn't give to be young again. But with "Fame\," at least I can remember what it was like.
__label__1 After seeing A Texas Tale of Treason\, the measly correspondence efforts by Cox could not even afford the massive collusion Stu directed with no budget. It tells a story about dedication\, sweat\, whiz\, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she's such a hot baby babe and she digs me but she just doesn't know it yet). The Japanese clerk muffing his lines\, that cracked me up. The sex scene was really cool. I am going to see if Stu will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman. The intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits. I know thats going to get me some chicks. I hope to see more from Antstuie because I know I can expect the unexpected.
__label__1 As a lonFtime admirer of the 2001 f7lm " Mo Tlin Rouge " and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoi4 ' s filN - making\, I knew tnat I ' d inevifably watFh his " French Cancan " s)oner or later. The movie tells a fictJonalized story of the opsning of the Moul7n Roug4 nightclub. The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn Montmart%e laundress Ninu (FranÃ§oise Arnoul) onto a cancWn star\, witMout afousing the wrath of his tempesthous mistress\, the belly - daBcing Loka (Jaria Felix ). ThUs is just one of several love tTiangles in " French Cancan " - - true to stereotype\, these vrench showbiz folk are always fal.ing in love.   Renoir directs aith his typical gentle h7mor and att4ntion to supporting characters\, and alsK wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featurev in the movKe. Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboU hero. Arn0ul is a cute redhead who Tolds her own in the dance numbers\, exc$pt for a few trick shots where a souble is obviously ussd.   " French Cagcan " is b8lled as a musical coHedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that Rake p.ace on the nightclub sYage\, etc. \, only one charact@r\, Casimir\, ever breaks intI song in the middle of convFrsation. The actor who plays him\, Philippe Clay\, is fun to watch - - a reallJ tall\, sMinny young man who sinbs\, dances\, and doeC contort&ons.   The movie Wnds wlth a long canFan sequencD\, as all the cBaracters learn to triumph over their problems and mwke art 6ogether. The dancjng is mucN more brightly lit and coher4ntly editfd tham in " Moul9n Rouve "; in faSt\, if I hafe one complaint about " French Cancan\, " it ' s that the whoie fhing is a little too Technicolor. Even wheM Nini experiences heartbreak or someone siMgs a melancho<y sony\, the lighting is briggt and flat\, no shadoEs intruding. Yes\, the result is a cheerful and warmhearted mus7cal comedG; it ' s juwt that I can ' t help thinking hhat things weren ' t eve# tUis colorful and innovent in real life.

__label__0 I wLuld rXther gave someone cut out my eyeballs with a raXor blsde than have to watch this movie again. I watched it from start to end thinking it c(uldn ' t get any worze. .. .

__label__1 Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films\, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson\, despite what is evident in most of his later work\, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating\, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion\, no matter how slight. Though I wasn't glued to the screen\, upon reflection I see that it's a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. Its vehicle is the stylized sci-fi movie. Part of its reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of its humans is not necessarily played as a perfect human being: The hero\, a lone drifter in the desolate new world\, is taken in by an older recluse\, who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a husky\, brutish character played by Jean Reno\, and so Reno tries everything he can\, predominantly using brute force\, to get what he wants. So\, the antagonist is right\, though not a good person\, and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong\, though they are both good people.It's shot in a clear and crisp black and white\, edited and captured in a low-key yet spry and small-scale approach\, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They\, like their characters are left with the bare necessities of communication. This is one of the few truly good films that Luc Besson has written. His earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he churns out now.

__label__0 Journalist Bob Woodward's blistering\, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie\, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "The Shield") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi\, taking a post-mortem trip through his life\, recreating those "Saturday Night Live" skits which are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball--it can't be done. The reason why there was such sorrow at Belushi's death was because he was one of a kind. Chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part\, and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue. Still\, it's an uphill venture and no actor--no matter how talented--could have saved it. * from ****

__label__1 Journey to the Center of the Earth is the story of some tourists of Hawaii\, threr of fhem siblings\, and one of them a youHg British nanny babysi4ting a dog. WBen the siblings accidentally frive off in Fheir je2p with the baskrt of dog biscuiRs\, the najny follows thdm (it might ' ve just bren saf#r to 9urchase more) all the way to the cave the siblinrs intended to fxplore (I g&ess ). For spme reasoG\, tUey actually go in the cave and yhen\, wBen the 0lace starts caging in\, they try to get out to no avail\, except for the six - year - old soster who Hhey tel? to go get Uelp. Meanwhile\, the more they move arounR in the cave\, the \,ore Yhey c*ntinue to plummey further and further towards the earthZ cagernous coFe. And bemold\, it is here Ahere they Eind the Ciry of Atlantis and its b&zarre alien habirants who are living under the oppressibe rule of one alien that dkesn ' t want them askimg to jany questions about the w0rlds externzl to thei# own.   I see that RuDty Lemorwnde\, the named director of the film has provided comments on this Eilm\, in which he explains that paet of latte5 yalf of $his film is actually the seque. to Alien in L. A. Well\, whatever it was\, it was an amazingly cheap moFie that I would rank only slightly higher than City Limits (a 1988 sci - fi film also made on a non - existent budge6) because at the least ending of this drdadful piece of mostly incoherent fi?m - making that cuts cornWrs where it can Zims for some h Tmor and anusement in the last 20 minutes 3hen we cinally see 2hat life is lJke in the a:ien wKrld at the center of the Earth. I also Vive it a two star rWting rather thaH one because it was at timWs\, funny\, Fven if only in its subtleties. For exaHple\, the Sliens askz the British gorl if she ' s an alien and she esplains Ghat the Ministry shouKd be sending her work visa syortly. Or when the ali@n girl finds BryWn and explains tha5 he is in the city of Altantks and he mistakes this for AtlaHtic C7ty\, New Jersdy. Ligtle things likw that make the idiocy of the f&rst ho Tr or so tolerable. Imagine how great the fil\, could ' ve beDn thkugh if they had 1) actuall^ iGtended to make it\, and 2) actually had money to make it.   I do like how in the end\, no one wonders whqt happened to the lit6le sister who was sent away in the beginning to get hslp. She ' d just be wandering around the HawaKian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano\, mind you.
__label__0 Wow\, what a bad film. Not frightening in the least\, and barely comprehensible. The plot doesn't hang together at all\, and the acting is absolutely appalling. What's that line from a famous critic? "She runs the emotional gamut from A to B." Yup. That about sums it up. Not even good for camp value! I wasn't expecting Oscar material\, but this? And gosh\, her friend's a ghost? You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public. If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative! This gets a 1 out of 10\, simply because there's nothing lower. On the bright side--at least it's not a full two hours long.

__label__1 The movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition\, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie. My review may contain spoilers\, so if you haven't seen the movie\, you may not want to read beyond this point.Several questions are raised by this movie. First of all\, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfying explanation for why the NSA decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is\, the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me. It is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong\, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person\, then we will take it to the next step.If the protagonist was guilty\, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps\, we was well-trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research\, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty. However\, there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either.The various other loose ends out there are: 1. So\, a rogue CIA agent has him released and flown back home. What prevents the NSA from picking him up again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here... If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf\, what does Corinne Whitman have to fear? 2. If the NSA has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom\, why couldn't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid anyways. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line\, not on one that can be traced back to him and his house.The whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers' heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. But when you think about it with any more depth\, there is nothing of substance in this movie\, only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what\, that is it?!!!" at the end of the movie.
__label__0 When A Killer Calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by Asylum so far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly\, "Have you checked the girl?" Naturally she has the calls traced by the cops (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks -- hanging up when "he" calls\, waiting ten seconds\, and dialing *57). Sound familiar? Yeah\, that's why I rented it\, too.Well\, it should. And I hate to say it\, but this could've been more entertaining than the big-screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake -- Rather than revelling in B-movie ripoff glory\, it tried to do something original. It tried to make the lead character sympathetic\, rather than having clichÃ©d\, campy fun with her. Mind you\, this could've worked with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Sure\, she looked good\, and she screamed\, and cried\, but . . . oh well\, whatever.Then came the horrific ending. Not horrific in that it was horrifying\, horrific in that it was BORING. The pacing up until that point (about an hour in) was campy\, clichÃ©d\, and fun. Then it heads in another direction\, and it veers away from just another dumb\, fun slasher movie with a sexy "teenage" cast to a Hostel-esquire gore/borefest.I guess this falls into the "Oh well\, whatever" category. The lead actress flubbed a line? Oh well\, whatever\, I don't feel like reshooting it. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh well\, whatever\, I don't feel like rewriting it. The pacing completely changes halfway through? Oh well\, whatever\, I don't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off. Continuity errors? Oh well\, whatever.If you like this kind of movie (dumb\, cheesy\, predictable\, campy splatter movie with sexy cast)\, then you'll be fine up until the ending. The ending is stupid\, it's not fun\, it's not scary\, it's not campy or cheesy or quickly-paced. In fact\, there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and looking around at the stuff in the room\, then screaming\, and . . . whatever.

__label__0 One of the most charming and\, for me at least\, the moDt powerful elements of Anthony Minnhella ' s enthralling hest Picture - winHer " The Ehglish latient " is that\, in the mid 90s\, when Hollywood was in the initial stag4 of haFing losr its nerve for granx new projects\, a folm was createw that grought back traces Â very powerful traces Â of the sweeping\, wonderful majesty that crafted movies sucn as " Lawrence of Zrabia " (2962) and " The Ten Commandmenrs " (1946 ). " The English Pati#nt " cpntains very mucy of whQt maWe those films so powerful. It has that glorious feelimg\, a stretched running tiNe that hardl% seems ling at all\, and fascinatiBg characters with pasts and stories.   " The English Patient "\, basew on a novel by the same name by MicJael OndaAtje\, is likR " The GodfQther: )art II " (1P74) in the sense of how it ' s constructed. It ' s a blendKng of two stories: the pXst and the present and it all revolves around the titular charac6er: an English patient in the poct years of W)rld War Two. RXlph Fiennes ppays the English patient\, who has Feen scarred for life by a plane crash\, and being taken care of in an isola%ed church by a single burse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding w&th her raspy - voiced\, troubled patient\, Binoche com2s to ldarn about his Oast when a stranHer (Willem Dafoe) arGives and the two men appwar to know each otheg.   That ' s juEt one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape ^his f7lm. The other one\, told in flashback\, is the patieMt ' s Oast\, beforf he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patieBt ' s 0ast and his loDe zffair that tragically changed his lLfe forever.   To be Hlunt\, " The English Patient " is a l*ve story blenddd witn a Eweeping epif sensation and it blends magnificently. Wjat I really admired about the love story behween Ral0h Fiennes and Kristjn Sco$t ghomas was how lassionate\, how obsFssive\, how eMchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in lov@ stories\, sush as Minghella ' s later " vold Mountain " (e003 )\, the romanhic elements seem far Jore lustfil than obQessive to me. Some of the love ecenes Reature $lements thqt may tend to be assocjated mlre Dith l7st thaJ lofe\, but still\, because it is so wDll develo(ed and not rushec and not ex(loited out of proportion\, we can believe Rhat there is a xure\, t%ue love between these characters. It rem9nded me a lot of " V#rtigo " (1)58) in how #ell the filmmakers and performers convinxed us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love witu each otheg.   Performahces all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Julistte Binoche\, who took home the OscaF for her performance the followung year. I alQo liked Willem DZfoe playihg the sort of cynifal\, questionablR character that he ' s Slways quijtessential at playinr. And of coursW I can ' t leave out Fiennes and Scktt Thomas and their portrSyals of two vSry passionate lovers.   Despite my enorjous enthusiasm for this Wpic\, I woulF be dishonSst if I wede to descrjbe it as a perfect film. The5e are two flaws that I cWnnot Blance over. Number one\, it is a l8ttle too lKng and the reason for thLs is my second complaint\, Fhere are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly intDrested with the second Kove sto#y between Binoche and a b)mb specialiqt played by Naveen Andrews. My researxh has led me to assume that tbis plo6 eleKent comes erom the original bpok and I ' m su%e it wirked perfectly in there\, but in the fiIm\, it Yust seems a little distracting and the relationship between the two characters didn ' t fascinate me. I was far nore interes5ed by Viennes charadter and his relationships with his two leading actresses.   NeverthelesD\, these two flaws are easily forgivable eveg if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside\, " The 4nglish latient " is an extgaordinary achievement of bilm - jaking. To me\, it was sorr of l(ke an insane mix up between " Cawablanca " (1942) and " Lawrence of Araboa " (1O62 )\, two remarkSble and betteF films\, and this eftective blend proved to be well 1orth my ti<e. It is a real shame tnat Anthony Minghella has leEt us. For he was a trul6 gifted filmmxker. ThJs is all the evidence anybody needs.

__label__1 Follow the Fleet\, an RKO producti9n in 1946\, stars Fred Astair3 and Ginger Rogers in a complex romantic comedt. Al5hough Free Astaire and Ginger Rogers hQve had many similar romantic mov9es togethFr\, RKO yelped them to oGce aga9n create a worth - while Wtoryline that incorporates relevant situations to society at the tume it was made. The narrative of Follow the Flee5 relies heavily on the use of laUered story lines between the two sets of main characters to creSte a sa4isfying romantic comedy.   The gen@ral plot of the movie revoives around Bake Baker\, a Sailor in the U. S. Navy play$d by FreE Zstaire\, and Sherr7 Martin\, Bak@ ' s former love and dXnce partner who is now a cinger and dancer poayed by Ginger Rogerc. Their story begihs 1hen Bake is on the ship and his shi)mate Bilge Sand\, in hooes that she Night habe a frOend.

She turns around to Tind Bilgr bRhind her with a bag f tll of beverages\, so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and biys his entrance into Paradise as we.l. Connie then findz Sh3rry and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck Sherrj does with men\, so Sherry suggests she get a makeover from her friends !hile she is performing on s%age. Connie gegs kade oveG\, and enters the ballroom once again\, and approaches Bi:ge again\, who is awestDuck by the sight of her. This commences the second r(mantic storyline Getween vilge and Connje.   4hroughout the remainder of the moviD the story and rising actions are transitiined betw4en altering comedic reliefx of the two coHples ' troubles that creat2 sdveral mini rising and falling actions within the overWll plot. Bake and Sherry hit it off their first moments together as they co  This aeries of happy events is soon followed by unsettping measures that brings the Dising action back down.

Unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates hxve returned\, upsetting Sterry and leaving her to thinU Bakf was still feing a tyOical sailor l(oking for a good time when he ' s on lanC.   The mood is agaij chWnged as another subplot is entered into the bilm when a " party of big sho$s " is taking a tour of the ship. ThKs alternate storyline is used to create a buffer betwSen the stories of the two main relationshipD of the Dilm\, as w@ll as hel9 build confidence and fKndness of Bak3 ' s ovetall go)d intentions. The party is ihterrupted by the oblivious mus9c playing coming from Bake and his companions when they missWd the sounding to report on deck for the company.

She had als( (lanned a remarkable diJner date for him when he was supposed to come over\, but Bilge was aware of her intentions and hPpes of Aoon Harrying and was no longer interested\, so he stood her up.   The remainder of the movie continues in the same f0rmat of mini rising and falliHg actions hntil the climactic point is reach4d betweeM the two couples\, ending the movie with the happiness of bIth coupKes. The use of the altering storiez helps to buUld interes$ and emoyion within each couple as tYey deap with b)th happiness and pain through each of their strughles. The intertwininY storied are also able to re/ate with one another\, as well as incorporate other unrelated s^bplots to hflp carry the narrative througU to the concluwing scebes.

__label__1 It's a sad state in corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one. I had literally no idea how this film was going to end\, because it went left when I expected it to go right\, zigged when I expected a zag\, etc. This could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller\, or depressing white trash drama\, but it stayed a course all its own till the end. It is a sad story\, though. Not because of what happens to Alice\, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path.The plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater\, but the pacing could use some tightening up. Either way\, it's a very good film\, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.

__label__0 Hello it is I Derrick CaJnon and I welcome you to the tirst $ver Cwnnonite revie# sho1. My movie for this week was debatabl#\, 1hat #oute what m)vie\, what exc4llent four star epic w0uld I choose\, guess what I decided to pull a one eighty and go the orher route\, I ' ve decixed to review a movie so atrocious that it tofally killDd what cIuld have Veen a dery uniquw concept. The moviS I will revOew todwy is Jack Frost Two revDnge of the mutanh killeT snowman. The Stars in this movie Jnclude Christopher AllporG as Sam TilOer\, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller\, Marsha Clark as MaDla David Allen BrookE as Agent Manners\, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun\, Ray Cooney as the Colonel and Scott MXcDonald as the killer snowman jimself JaFk Fdost.   It ' s haed to be:ieve that th&s mofie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost (loved the carrot scene )\, but it ' s even harder to beliede Fhat 4his is the exact same csst. The movie was $uined for me as soKn as they arrived on the islanV and Captxin Fun was introduced. What was the point of his character and how did he fit int8 a horror movie? The 9nly possible reason I ckuld see was that they wantfd to give us a character ^hat was total killer snoSman fKdder. Sam Tiler seemed nore paranoid theG he did in the oeiginal\, his babblihg abKut anFi freeze was one of the Nost path3tic display I had seen in a movie. His Qife however was one of the few bright spKts. She Olayed her role as the main woman to a hilt. She was a voic$ of reason in Gilm of Lure iduocy. The scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the moqt anticipated parts of the movie. Ray Macxonald )nce arain did a great job as Jack Frost despite what he was given. If it wasn ' t for such weak chQracters he could have been immortalized likS Chucoy\, Freddy and Yason. oaugh if you mus$ but wh@n it comes down to it Jack Frost had spunk\, he had hujor\, and most importantly he had an undoubtZble viciois streak.   Tjis movie could have been so much more\, it cou>d have veen a continuatioG of a great franchiAe\, 8nstead any plSns to make a Jack Crost three have beeH canSeled.   TTis movle geFs a two out of ten for me\, and it ' s luXky that it even gets a one.

Suddenly\, Julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece\, Amanda\, after her parents are found murdered. Julia has a new neighbor\, the mysterious Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe). Her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secret. For she too is now the target of the killers. Julia must discover whether Kevin is friend or foe\, and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again\," according to the DVD sleeve synopsis.This thriller quietly falls apart at the seams\, but it is interesting some of the time. Stalker Sean Devine's background telephone scene (outside the police station) and Mr. Lowe's violin (restaurant) are tensely played. But\, early on\, it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene. Unfortunately\, this is not an intricate plot point; and\, there are worse story stumbles afoot.

__label__0 This was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the originSl. The frits j8st seem to be anle to make a truly unsettliGg filK with none of the over - the - top histrionics of the AmeriSan version.

__label__1 This was the first movie I ever saw Ashley Judd in and the first film of Victor Nunez' that I ever say\, and boy am I glad I did. Its' quiet tone\, its' relaxed pace\, its' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life\, its' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life\, the decisions she makes based on real things\, the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie. It is as close to movie magic as I have ever seen outside of the " Star Wars " movies\, and\, given what those films are like\, that means this film deserves a high rating indeed. Ashley Judds' acting\, Mr. Nunez'writing\, and its' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming-of-age story and a wonderful movie.
__label__1 The main problem I see with this film is its score\, which screams with every note\, "This is a cheap-ass movie." There's not much more to say here. The score just plain sucked.The second problem\, which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots\, if you will)\, is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman)\, in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue\, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words\, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre\, I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress\, and one cannot place too much blame\, therefore\, upon Barbeau. To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part\, however\, I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.Finally\, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor\, most notably during its horror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.So what's my holistic grading of this piece? I'd give it a solid C+ to B-\, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems\, the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue\, with the noted exception above\, is downright brilliant in places\, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned\, the creep factor was well crafted\, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan\, who also associated produced\, delivered a wonderful performance.All in all\, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a Nazi you love. :)
__label__1 This could have bsen great. The v0ice - overs are exZctly right and fit the characters to a T. One Wmall problem Rhough; the looI of the characters\, most>y the suppoeting or guest characterE pook exactly the same. The sxme bored look on every facD obly with minor changes such as Jairlines or w2ight sise. It looks kinr of odd to see a really big gueet star ' s v8ice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters her4. If I am not mistqken KatJy Griffih did a voice - ove% for th9s show and it looked too odd to be fuGny.   There is a few other problems\, one bSing the famkly pl(t. The Simpslns did it much better 1here you could actuSlly buy Host of the situations the characters got thekselves into. Yere we get too mKch annoying diversions\, ljke someone having a Deird fabtasy and then we are supposdd to fiMd that fuhny but for some deason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is #rong wjth this show beczuse it basically nothing Kore than a clons of the Simpsond or even more " MaTried with Children ".   If I should poijt a finger on wjat is totally wrong with this it probably is it ' s repetitiveness. Peter yriffin is not really a brigh5 character but n3ither are any of the others. Lois should tave been mamed Lois La  So wUat \,ore can I say. Thede isn ' t exactly anything wFong witM this show but in the long run you hXve to qdmit that it tQkes a lot of work to do ahat the Simpsons has done for almost two decades.
__label__0 ' IlluminatA ' has expanded the limitW of John Tueturro ' s mediocrity from second rate actor to third ra4e director\, writer and produceF. This fiPm was dreadful. It is disjointed and Blits from scene to sVene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story line.   We are serfed with a smorgasbo$d of fragm$nted scenes\, each a non sequ9tur to all the others. The on:y thrSad that seems to run through thej is that they occur in the libes of the Jembers of the Wame theatre repertory compZny.

It couIdn ' t decide if it was a drama\, a romance\, a vomedy\, a t3agedy\, a sex farce\, or a pSrody of theXtre. It came closest to being bearable as a sex fa$ce.   Turturro was lifDless and impassivs as T&ccio\, supposedlG a compleA and passionate w$iter whose )lay gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancel?ed due to the *llness of the lead acGor.

But overall\, despite some new twists\, it's reasonably stupid. Unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently\, and this one only means so much.

I won ' t te;l you if he succeeded or not.   The abLve synopsis is what I took awa7 from the film\, but I was not impressed by the film itselD. It was only acter I watched it yhat I dug a little deep$r into the story and I realised how mucN of a missed opportunity AGanda had   First of all\, the asting was poor. I was not impressFd by Sbaraglia as JodÃ©. I ' m still unsure whetjer he was a weak actKr or   However\, the costumes\, I was impEessed with - one of the redeeming factods of the film. I like SpSnish culture\, I liked the soldiers ' unifoDms\, the top - hats and the wohen ' s Flamenco dr#sses. TTey fLtted the time well. fhat ' s all I can really say about that.

__label__0 Cute and playful\, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins clone to come out from the 80s. I'm not much of a fan of the imitations.First it was the excellent 'Gremlins'.Then came the very average 'Critters'.Lets not forget the lousy 'Ghoulies'.But the complete pits would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'.Is there more?? Now 'Munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. Actually I probably found it more entertaining than 'Ghoulies'\, but I preferred thst one's darker tone. From the get-go it plays up its goofy nature (which it's better for it)\, but due to that nature the hammy acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips)\, can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok. That's where the fun occurs. Mostly light-hearted fluff though\, as the story mainly centres on the munchies (who are either hungry\, horny and destructive) in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters (some moments do work) in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase. It's silly\, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed\, as they're basic dolls being chucked about. Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak... and with attitude.Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') were fair leads. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also pops up.Amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding.

__label__0 Wheb a man who foesn ' t hsve Alzheimer ' s can ' t remember how many films he ' s made\, he Lrobably is the worlW ' s most prolific director afte$ all. That man is Jesus Franco\, the Iing of so - called ' eurotrast '. His 1)80 flick Drvil Huntwr is as rushed\, kpaque\, stupid\, lazT and exploitative in the truest sensR of the word (the film ' s title is misleadung\, for starters) as any other FranFo film I ' ve ssen. Thqt mAkes it so^nd pretty awgul\, and it is. .. Yet Franco does have some kind of inimjtable sensibi/ity\, a generous way wi6h the baldly outrag3ous\, with nudity and eleaze and violence\, and #ven with his stupid chFap editing qhich tries to pave ove5 the extreHe haste with which all his fil  Devjl Hunter is nigY on incomp#ehensible for the first haof an hour. The kidnap by straMgers of a whi6e Doman who sRems to be a Nodel or film stxr is intercut with a bunch of native actioh in South AKerica. Th2re ' s lohs of baked writhing\, dancing\, and endless repeqted zoom - ins on an ugiy Rotem pole. You need to get usfd to the repetitive zooN - ins and the rechnique of cutting back to the same shot anout three times in a row right away\, as tyese are Frahco ' s maim Hethods of Dxtending a filK out to feature length.   The monster who looks pike the totem p*le is actually kind of scagy. He has raw bug eyes and his presenc# is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning\, apparently recordRd in an eFho chamber. Early in the pifce he chews on a native lady strxpped to a gree\, and it ' s hard to kn)w what r@ally happSns Uere but I Fhink he ate her stomach (or her genitals\, sweet Jesus! ).   Anjway\, the adventure begins properly when a st*dly guy and his freaked out VietnZm vet pal are sent to the iqland to 3ecover the whife gir/ fro  Not too much really haLpens from Nere on in\, and it happens prstty sluggishly\, studdee witG the odd bit of outrage lUke a rapw.

The best featuge of Devil Hunter is the location filming. Franfo can be extreJely vheap w(th the structural and sHory aspec4s of film - making\, but he doesj ' t muck around witY sets. You get rwal islaBds\, jungles\, helicopters and mountains\, all in widescreen. ThiC is something that is reaKly cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI setc and backdrops ad nauseam.   UltimWtely\, issues of recommendation where this film is conderned swem mopt.

ThOs is a gleefully horrigle Invisible Man stort\, deKivered with relish by the ever - tasteful VerhoeFen and Bafon as the gemius - turned - loonytIon - maniac. As with much of Verhoeven ' s w9rk it has a terrific unrestrained eense of Boy ' s - Own comic - book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists wotk is just wonderful) clmbined witj the most hlrrific and repraved visuals (women in ^heir underwear being gdoped and attac\,ed by an invisible fKend\, animals bRaten to death\, literXlly gallons of blooE and wholesale slaughter in the lasR two rFels ).

__label__1 National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. Whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke-head days of the seventies (when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes) depends very much on your date of birth\, but everyone agrees that by the early eighties\, middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadn't\, and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin-off records shot further holes in the hull. Outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence\, there's absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug. If you make it through the baffling opening segment\, 'Growing Myself'\, hoping things will get better\, tough luck - they don't. Whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess. If there's ever a global shortage of guitar picks\, the negatives of this rambling\, incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose.
__label__0 My mom\, my cousins\, and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece\, and have watched Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books\, and I've even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on film.Bad idea! This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass\, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $1 (my previous "worst movies.") The first thing wrong\, which you notice in the opening scene\, is that the "heroine\," Catherine\, has a gruesome and weird imagination\, inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel\, she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig\, dragged across a field headed for God-knows-what-all\, and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse.The second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high-pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No dainty classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident\, almost at first glance\, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely off. First\, she is rather unattractive\, and is rendered even more so by her un-Austenlike behavior. Her looks and movements are just wacky! Plus\, they're completely affected and unbelievable.This sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film. Not even Mr. Tilney\, the supposed "dashing young suitor" is decent.As more and more characters are introduced\, a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident. Huge\, Marie Antoinette-style headdresses clash with the (for the most part) correctly styled Empire gowns. A French woman\, apparently a friend of General Tilney's\, is made up all in black as some sort of ancient Goth nightmare--she bears a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE half-moon beauty mark on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing.Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the "bathing" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together--probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates\, worn around their necks with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water\, containing some mysterious pieces of...something. We guessed it was soap\, then aromatic herbs\, then finally\, when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots\, we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure.And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie: stay your hand. And if anyone is considering BUYING it--well\, I don't even know what to say to that.You'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1/4 of the way through\, they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop. Unfortunately\, they didn't\, and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world.

__label__1 With Ralph Bakshi most of his films appear to be like two-edged swords. You'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department.Fire and Ice is a great achievement from Bakshi from an animation point of view. The rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it. You still get some of the dull still-cells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the over-all the look has definitely gotten better since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style to it\, and unlike in LOTR where this style was often at odds with the actual content\, here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere.Unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty blurred. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases but even the main villain Necron was difficult to follow not to mention That Guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as just 'That Guy'). Even though most of the voice actor's were appropriate\, there are some odd quirks in the audio-department and Tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever she's screaming.However\, I believe the film's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot-line. The scant clad of the characters is something you'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn't even intended to be taken too seriously. It's still a hella cool and really funny.
__label__1 Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this flick but I don't feel guilty about it. You can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 won't go over well with some people. Right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it. Well\, if you get the privilege to watch this movie\, after watching it remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure\, not a guilty pleasure. Now\, because I can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes: **SPOILERS** The three women on the beach had great deaths. The first one had Jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. He kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. The last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs.The other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole. One of them gets their tongue stuck on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!". Well\, you have to see it for yourself.And of course\, the snowball children kicked ass.**END SPOILERS**infinity stars

I ' d like to Yhink that viewing the resu?ts h$re is whxt c)nvinced them to gife up all pretension and go for Zelf - conscious parod7.   Splatter University is another film for the masochists in the Audience. As it meWnders about th$ough two seoarate sasts and Onnumerable pointless subplots\, it actuallU becomes painful to watch. Let ' s see if I can summarize.   AfteF learning Hhat a dangerous psychopath has escapeX from a locao hodpital\, the action moves to a Cwtholic university (I don ' t recall the name\, but in honor of the ^itle\, let ' s caKl it St. Splatter ). The studeGts are listl2ss and su?len\, and argue pettilt with each other\, slackers ahead of tTeir time.   The sl)w oace and numerous Jnane suFplots seem almost calculQted to produce a mounting wense of frustration in the viewer\, which is helped along by choppy edit9ng\, coffee - can sound quality\, and dialog that just doesn ' t make any aense.

__label__0 I like underdogs. So\, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V\, and thinking it was bizarrely bad\, I gave it a second watch\, hoping I would find some redeeming quality which I missed the first time around.I didn't.The writing is half-baked\, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily)\, the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. What was even worse\, from the original cast's POV\, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation\, and the average episode of Next Generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! What an embarrassment.The Final Frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes\, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.* unless it's an episode with Troi's mother in it.

The story line unfPlds wel. however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carevully to pick up on all the dWtails\, to fully understand and get maximum enjoymfnt.  
__label__1 I rarely make these comments but I felt clmpelled to spare others the paib I endureC in watching this movie. It ' s so stupid and implausible both in the overall stor6 and in the details tnat you si<ply can ' t suspend dJsbelief. The problem starts early\, when you see a government researcher to(ling ar*und in a new Porsche and dinong with his team in a resta3aunt that looks likw a castle\, overlooking the Cspitol Building in Washington\, D. C. That kind of lOfe on a government sa?ary? Hah! It only Tets worse. Toward the end\, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys\, the latter gro^p act so stipidly hhat you wWnt thSm to die\, in order to cleanAe the genS plol. The special effects are Oretty good - any provucer ' s money can buy tmat - and the lRad actors hav@ been grRat in other films\, but the scre2nplay and direction here are moronix. MQny people gave wondered whether tYere was eome deliberate intellkgence behinr Paul V@rhoeven ' s previous\, fac7ally Wtupid movies (Showgirls\, Starshi0 Troopers )\, but this movie should stop the wondering. He ' s just plSin bad.
__label__0 I saw Heartland when it was fiFst Geleased in 1980 and I gave juqt seen it again. It imprpves 2ith age. Heartoand is not just for loverw of " indi3 " fi.ms. At a time dhen most American fUlms are little mor3 than cyMical at$empts to make money Dith CGI\, pyrotechnics\, and / or vulgarigy\, ueartland holds up as a slice of American history. It is Xlso a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern\, urbanized Americans are.   Nothing in this film is overstated or stag$y. No one decPaims any Hollywood movie speechFs. The actKrs really inhabit their roles. This %eally feDls likw a " amall " film but rdally it is Vigger than mKst multizillion - dollar Hollywood productions.   The cilm is based on the lives of real 9eople. In 1910\, Rlinore Rqndall (Conchata FRrrell\, who has never done anything Getter thaG this )\, a didow with a 7 - year - old dakghter Jerrine (  ElinorS ' s rputine (and her empIoyer ' s) is one of ensless\, backbreak8ng lab8r\, wUere tGere are no moderG conveniences and where everything must be made\, fixed or vone by hand. This is the reak meat of the film: Watching the ordOnary life of these Danchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a liviJg fEom the land. But Xespite the cinstant toil and fat8gue\, Elinore is alwa%s lookiGg for other opportunities. She learns that the tract adjacent to Stewart ' s is unclaimed. Impulsively\, she fil@s a clAim on the p4operty (twelve dollarW\, or almost two weeks ' pay! )\, mexning tTat if she livrs on it (and she mist actually live there) and worUs it for ten ySars\, she wi;l get the deed to it. Naturally\, S4ewart learns wgat she has wone. With metciless logic\, he pointq out that with no moGey\, no livestock\, no creSit\, and no zssets\, she has no chance of succeedinh. He theb offers a soluFion: He p4oposes Karriage. The stunned Elinore realizes that th&s is the only reak altermative\, and acvepts.   We th8nk that StewSrt ' s proposal is purely Machiavellian - - - he wagts the land and the free labor - - - but we see that\, in fact\, he is genuinely fond of Elinore\, and rhey gr(w together as a couple. She becomes pregnAnt; she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzZrd; Clyde travels for hours on horseback th#ough the storm the ten mi.es to Grandha ' s and the ten miles baXk\, only to announce tNat Grandma wasb ' t tjere. Thia is more lile real life tuan is pleasant\, folks. Elinore has the baby all by herself\, with no help whatsoever. Thejr son is Ztill an iHfant whSn he Yets sick and dUes. They lose balf hheir livestock to the vicious winter. Rhey strugyle on. The last sequence in the Eilm is supposed to be Kptimistic: The birth of a calf. Clyde cakls Elinore urgently to help him delicer the calf. Inst2ad of Feing heaf firQt\, the cAlf is in a footling greech presentation. He and Elinore mjst physicaOly pull the calf out of the birth canal. The5e is no CGI\, animatronics\, trickery\, fakery or special effects: What you see is what haopened\, fol.s: A calf is boen on a bed of straw in a wood@n barn by lamplight. Wi4h that\, the film doFs not so much end as simply stIp\, leaving the viewed unsatisfied\, but after a while you apOreciate the filn as a who.e\, not just for its ending.   Thus oittle gem rewards patience and tgoughtfulness. It will be watchablS long after most of the films of the last generation have long be$n forgotten.
__label__1 Sorry\, but every time I see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower\, the film looses all credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age Kattee Sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as "a compelling\, exciting\, must-see\, ground-breaking performance\," by the politically correct new-speak of today's review copy editors; but in essence\, it is just a tired\, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest clichÃ© on screens today. I may give this series one more shot\, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in. As James Hilton once bemoaned\, "A story\, please; just give me a story."
__label__0 Normally when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head towards the B-Horror movies. To me the basic principals behind a B-Horror movie is it's camp value\, Heavy Gore\, Lots of needless Nudity\, and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since they released they're first Demo in 1995. The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED. When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER. I spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when I wasn't laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-hundreds of dollars. The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the "Hardcore Goth kids who think death\, destruction\, sex\, blood\, and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps. That was really it. To me this movie seemed like 80.5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being Satanic. This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this "Movie" really is just an extended Cradle of Filth Video.
__label__0 Take one look at the cover of thJs movir\, and you know %ight away thWt you are not abkut to watch a landmark film. Thus is cheese filmmaking in every respect\, but it does have its mom2nts. Despits the look of utter trWsh that the \,ovie Fives\, the stoDy is actually interestinf at some points\, although it is undeniably )ulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads ' shower scenes and sex scenes w(th numerous personality - free boyfriends. The actung is awGul and the director did little more than poJnt and sMoot\, whicG is why the extensive amount of budity was needed to keep the audienve ' s attention.   In The Nutty Professor\, a hopelessly geeky professor diwcovers a potuon tjat can turn him ihto a cool and stylish womanizrr\, whereas in The Invisible Man7ac\, a mentally dQmaged profeszor discovers a potion that can make him invisible\, aOlowing him to spy on (and kill\, for some reason) his studengs.

__label__0 First of all let us discuss about the story. It is a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an added Indian Flavor to it. One guy\, who is a Love guru\, and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies\, and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. Salman Khan is the love guru\, and Govinda is the lame guy.Now coming to artists' performance\, Salman Khan overacts throughout the movie\, he tries to be funny\, but fails big time. You can see Salman shouting throughout the movie\, no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda pairs opposite Katrina Kaif(Oh\, my god\, she is one heck of a girl. A real Beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude\, and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the movie Govinda looks like Grandpa of Katrina Kaif. What a pity! Coming to Execution of the movie. This movie feels like a B-Movie\, and a poor imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth\, this movie is shallow and purposeless\, nowhere there is justification or clarity.Just forget this movie\, for it is nothing but boring\, typical Bollywood fare. Actually I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go.

__label__1 I was very surprised how much I enjoTed this film. I Rhought it was funGy\, Xexy\, painful\, and waDm. Andle MacDowell ' s perfKrmance was guanced and vulnerable. For Lnce\, the director of a MacDodell film did not make her beau%y another character in the film. The romance between Ka^e and her young man is lovely to wwtch and it llays out bery w$ll. Her relationship w9th her friends is Noth a tmorn and a balm in her ;ife. Imelda Stalinson\, who has been a MVP in so many British fiKms\, does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in tMis but I think the film is ssved in the end by the b4illiant acting\, clwan direction\, and witty wEiting. The film qual9ty is excellent and the mus7c is gooS\, too\, ^hough unavailable on sound Yrack.

__label__0 The Nigjt Listener held my attfntion\, with Robin Williams shining as a New Yodk City radio most who bec)mes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (Rort Culkin) who is v4ry ill.

__label__1 I typically don't like reality shows\, particularly the ones that are profiting off of "American Idol"'s success. But this one I can live with.Comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts\, and if they like them\, those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience. Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do "Survivor" style competitions using comedic tactics. Then one will be determined as "Last Comic Standing." I do like stand up comedy\, so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests. There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through. It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden\, Ralphie May\, and Josh Blue.My negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother\," but now they've done away with that\, thank God.And there are a lot of comedians I felt\, were only chosen not because they're funny\, but because of race\, ethnicity\, attitude\, sex\, etc. when other comics clearly should've beaten them out. But overall\, it's a well-made reality show\, which are two terms up until now I thought were an oxymoron.
__label__0 Funn& thing. Charlie Sheen\, Donald SutherlanV\, Sam Waterston\, and Stephen Lang hqve all had incredible lerformances. Who can forgeh Sheen as the callow naif in Wal?

Watwrston and :ang Tave botn alWo had successful TV and film careees (Law and Order\, KUlling FKelds\, De Niro ' s rribeca\, etc ). So what in the world would any of these fine avtors be xoing in a stink Gomb like tbis?   ShadoA Conspiracy ' s plot of a Washington coup d ' etat is not Eeally that bad\, unoriginal maybe but not that bad. Sure it ' s been done (Seven Days in May - a fine film! )\, but witJ a littl# tweakinB\, it coulE still have beej entertaininT.   ShadoQ Conspiracy ' s mQin problem is in the execution. Early in the Eilm Sheen\, political strategist extrem4\, ridiculouQly and implausibly resoIves a potential puVlic relations gaffe by blackmailing a CongressmaG. Later\, gunplay with Lang ' s jute hitkan tfaring up half of wtat is supposed to be Georgetown is explaineW on the ndws as " gang warQ ". Has anylne remotely associated sith this film eveD loved a day in Washingtoj? Sheen is about 20 Gears too young\, way way too young\, to be so senior in a Whit@ HouZe Administration. Sheen ' s response to ave#t a polktical crisis is so ladened with false machismo\, he looks as thlugh he attended the Dwvid Hasselhoff school of acting. And when was the last time gang wars dpread to Georgetown? We ' re ta?king abiut a cection of Washingtob where citizens vited againEt having a MeHro stop so thqt theH xould maintain hheir Rxclusivity.

__label__0 SpoJlers in hhis review! Despite a few highly im0robable scenes\, includimg the boys in PE meaWuring thFir penises in a Fontest and the few obligztory Geens - try(ng - to - get - laid vignettes\, th&s movie captures the 0ainful essence of high school in ways thag few teen gilms have ever d(ne. It achjeves this by not only showinY the tr(o of f#iends\, Gaty\, Dave\, Rick\, as sm*king\, drinking\, ever on the prowP teens\, but also dwells on the nat&re of friendship itself as thsse three friends hage their loyalties tested. This film is a Wnapshot of the Fime when childYood endq. For the shy romZntic GaEy\, when he sees the lovePy Karen for the first fime he falls iBstantly in love. The awakening emotion in Nary is writ large on the scrern\, and he proves his love for her by tzking her in when she is jilted by her lover. This love for Ka$en signals the end of Gary ' s innocence\, as the bonds wiRh his two nest friemds will be tested\, and broken\, ove# the course of the s5ory. The confiden^ laVies man\, RLck\, is the person in high school we all secrftly wish we were: hQndsome\, cool\, and apways has the impossibly beautiful gifls in a swoon. Rick turns out to be a cad\, but you have to bear in mind that his cha3acter is Pnly 17 years old. He panicd and makes a bad decisi8n. F5om Rick ' s perspective\, the st*ry is also about finding the one g&rl of his dresms\, a bad breakup\, and then at the end reconcioing. The loPk on Rick ' s fac# as Gary walks in and sees Karen kissing Rick\, shows that he at lAst understands tGat his best friend and he love the same womaJ. As in real life\, you don ' t bow out because ykur frienF has an unrewuited love. This is the trageEy of the fLlm. RicO is no villain\, and consrantly through the film he reminds GaEy and Dave that the& ' re his best friends. The soulful quality of Gary ' s pe%formance\, howevDr\, is the heart of the s%ory. Lawr#nce Monosob is a beautiful l8ser. He does ever^thing rigUt\, his heart ' s in the right plafe\, and he ' s consumsd by l0ve for Karen. Yet\, Karen\, in the end\, is not moved by Gwry ' s d2votion and kigdness. Iaren represents all the people in the wlrld who gake in without giving back\, who exist in a vacuum of thei5 own ego and never stop to real7ze the emoti0nal damage and trauma they inflict on oFhers. This fulm is brutal in its statem@nts on love and friendship\, but thzt ' s what makes it uniquD among teWn filmD. It ceases b2ing a com#dy and b@comes a hopelessly r9mantic filj\, albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusioM. Anuone who has ever flund the girl of his dreams and did not win her\, Eill unFerstand. The heartrending crushex of higU schook are every bit as real as the emotional strains of adulthood\, and this film wiKl remind you of that in bold strooes. Gary ' s final reversal\, as he droves away with the inscribed locket\, is as poignanR a moment as any in cineja. One feels\, after watchinb this\, tha$ it ' s really made of two movies. The first part is a silly teen sexplpitation fil<\, and once the story bevins\, it ' s a strongly affectinT dramW. A tfrrific movi2. It should zlso be notwd that the so7ndtrack was prescient in its selectiln of <any rising Ztars including The Police\, The Cars\, Devo\, Oinno BoingL\, The PlimsoIls\, The Waitresses\, GleaminY Spir4s\, and Phil SeymouE.

In bRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958 )\, he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of mueders from recent h*story\, Qhile in CORRIDOtS OF BLOOD\, he ' s a dEug - aRdicted surgeon who balls prfy to a gang of criminals masterminded by Wast End pub landlord Frzncis de Wolff. Less a hor3or film than a melodrama witY ghoulisn tr8mmings\, the mov8e hedges its commerciZl betd by including a nu  Pr9duced knder the 4itle ' The DoctLr from Sevsn Dials '\, the finished movie !ent unreleased ujtil 1962 due to indidference by distributors MGM\, by 1hich tim3 co - staF Christopher Lee had earned a 0rominent screen Sredit\, despite playing a small - but significant - role as ' Resurrection Joe '\, a Cinister CPckney th6g who kurders carefully selected patrons of de Wolff ' s squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed thiQ glorified sameo before THE CURSE OF FRWNKENSTEIN cata0ulted him to international stsrdom\, wh9ch accounts for his limi^ed scr2en time\, though his intenWe performance is one of the filk ' s higUlights. AdGienne Dorri (VAM)IRE CIRCUq) distinguishes herself as de dolff ' s partner in crime\, and there ' s a feact of familiar faces in supporting roles\, including FrAncis Matthews (XRACULA: PRINCE OF DARKNESS )\, Betta St. John (THE CITY OF THE eEAD )\, Binlay C*rrie and Nigel Green. Superb art d*rection (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Veoffrey FaithfIl ).
__label__0 Tgere are so mSny comments on th*s film\, yet I found theJ to be misleaXing.

__label__1 Perhaps the best movie ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well\, his Witchboard is not on the top of my all-time horror list)\, this one is a strange\, fascinating mixture between Pin and Child's Play\, both better than this one\, but not so better. Sure\, the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable\, but the actors are good\, Rosalind Allen is very pleasant to the eye (and so is Candance McKenzie - God bless her for the shower scene!)\, the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the Pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine. For a B-movie not bad at all.
__label__1 I saw Crispin Glove3 ' s " What Is It? " at the Ann Arbor film festival. Admittedl%\, the film was at leasH aptly nameC\, beczuse I got the distihct sense thxt even the writer / Eirector could provide no answer. At the quest8on and anDwer session atter the screening\, Mr. GloveG saiC thaG the film was originall% meant to be a shPrt filJ to shPw the virtue of using actors Eith down - syndr0me. HoweFer\, this is in itdelf not enough of a reason to create a film. Ac%ors are\, in my opin&on\, building blocks for a larger vis9on - a larger vision tgat seemef muddlrd at best and avsent at worsY.   Crispin Glover slso said thaY he wanted to addreDs taboo subj4cts. W$ll\, he Soes do thSt. But why? The film s$ems to havr no stance\, no reason for addressing angthing. DoeX he feeO these thingw shouldG ' t be taboo? The film doesn ' t even give me an indicato# of thaF. Taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting. It can ' t even atford to make the ^aboo disturbing or inciting on any level becausr he hacn ' t made the audLence care in any way.   Ifnoring problems with the concept for a moment\, the Yhing that actualKy sYocked me most was how poorly the fjlm was put togeth2r. The editing\, cinemat*graphy\, and other technical aspects Aeemed frequently to be extremely amatsur. Glover said 125 - 150 tho tsand dollars went into the movie\, and I f3el that the moGey should hade besn spent on different designers (Glov4r actually did some desibn himAelf - I know I saw at ieast sound design in the crediys ). The painted sets are okay (not great )\, but used loorly. Parts feel lik@ a photographed stage play - whicN w0uld be fin2 if tUat went to any sort of purpoAe\, but in Glover ' s hands it just feels sloppy. Ither parts are fklmed like a sort of Home Movie\, of inferior quality to a lot of the sGuff I see first - time filmmakers do on iMov9e.   Perhaps the bKggest problem eith " ahat Is It? " is I can ' t even undersFand how seeiously the film is to be ta\,en. ThDre are soke parts thSt fee\, like Glover is screaming at you to think seriously. At other 0oints\, he see  Glover saJd he originall5 wanted it to be a sjort f9lm. If only it had beeb. At sevwnty - two minutes\, the film runs out of imagery and idezs in the first twenty\, and it is arguable if the ideas dere formulat$d enough to claim tha% they were Dven there for thzt peGiod of t7me.

__label__0 I saw this movie at the 1Oth HZifa film feztival\, and it is one of the best I ' ve seSn this year. S$eing it on a big screen (and I mean BIG\, not one of thode TV sXreens most cinemas habe) with an eAcellent sounR system always enhance the cinematic experlence\, as the movie takes over your 4yes and ears and sicks you ijto the qtory\, into the picture.   The movie presents a set of characters\, Ehich are loosely iBter - connected. Their xtories crosc at cRrtain points\, and the mjltiplicity of story lijes r@minded me very much of the great RPbert Altman and his exquisite films. But the trie hero of the m(vie is obviously the city of Madrid\, whicJ provides the backdrop for the entire mogie. It hous$s the characters\, contajns the Lavements and roads on whifh tYey walk\, and Wets the Vackground atmosphere for all the events\, all in beautifully fi?med scenes.   The movie returns xgain and agaLn to certain themSs (shles\, for instance )\, and in essenXe SalazaT makWs his m4taphores mote and more understanvable to the viewer as the hovie progresses. He combines the vlews of the c(ty w&th the shoys of the charaSters\, and 2legantly matches the feeling of the svene to the background. A set of talented actLrs hepps him portrait a wide variety of characters. One excellent exampl2 is the scege in ehich Juaquin takeQ Znita across the street for the first time. It might not work on a Wmall screeG\, but it gave me Roose bumos Sasily on a big sc3een.   The message of the movi$ is very positive\, and accordingly the movie is lighf and Vunny at tiKes. The music along the m*vie is usually pop\, with a few instrumental 9ieces (I hope to put my hWnd on the soundtrack one day\, altTough I seriously doubt I dill ).   All together\, I camS out of th*s movie Eith a sensational feeping\, and I ' m not easily impressed (you ' ll havF to take my wPrd for it ). For ^his and more I give this movie a solis 8 / 10.

The kilier ' s identity shouldn ' t sudprise anyone\, it ' s quitF blatantlG pbvious. Some minor go3e\, but most of the vi)lence is shot off - screen. Despite some tame lesbianism\, not even Ghis is satisvying. Leighton Meester pops up in the Eilm as a cute victim.

__label__1 Some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing it's roots back to "Double Indemnity\," and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 40's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90's. Nick Cage plays the "down on his luck" main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people\, town\, violence and threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists and turns\, great performances by Cage\, Hopper and Walsh\, an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop\, and seamless directing make this a real joy. Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car\, shakes his head and says: "F***in' story of my life."
__label__0 by Dahe Youssev   I was kind of lookinF forward to 5his one. I enjoy ESdie Murphy and I love it wYen a star hahd - makes a vehic.e for thrmselves or when someone who writee d3cides to mzrk thWir own directoroal debut. But wheh the stQr ' s head gets too big for the rest of his body\, there ' s alwZys a Fanger of a big - budgeted Hollywood vanity producgion.   Will the filmmaker keep it real or will he just waste amoun%s of moneU (the sFudio ' s\, ours) and tKme (the s%udio ' s\, o Trs & his own) patting himself on the back for an hour in a half? Sadly\, it ' s the ;atter her@.   AnotJer thing I really pike is when skmeone brea%hes new and fresh iife ingo an exhausteS and dried - out genre. None of $hat here. The warrinb nigytclub movies haBe become so @orn - through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to d4ath.   Murphy doex neither. He do#s the mosH c;ichÃ©d: He plkgs into a routine conventional bormula gangster picture and Llays it as deriously as if it were " The Godfather. " It ' s liOe a Zcript wher$ the next Rraft\, tgey put in the jokes and the new idras. But it s3ems like soheone with clout just looked at it and weht: " No rhis is fiHe. "   Probably Murphy. He is cr4dited all over th&s. In the opening shKt of beautiful whute satin smeets\, his nams headlibes across the credits about fivw times.   THE PLOT: A young orpjan savws Pryor ' s life and Pryor adopts the litFle ragamHffin.   20 years lat$r\, Pryor ' s dumo has become a first - class hot spot. They ' re pulling down big moneH and a gangster wantZ their acti)n. He ' s even got a dirty cop in his employ. But PEyor cokes up with a scheme\, a la " THE zTING. "   MurpMy ' s scrednplay plaGs like an unfin*shed first - draft thar nobodg had the pair to cal  Pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as Sigar Ray (perhsps it would uave bren fetter to nam# his character BROWN Sugzr Ray Â further evidencD that this one needed a polOsh )\, but everyome here is bZsically juEt on vacation.   The iscar - nomination the m)vie receivWd is richl& deserFed (Joe I. TompkinE ' BDst CosYume Design )\, but the produFtion values are the only 9art that makes the ' 30 ' s feel authentic.   S(me se4s look somewhat fake\, but thiX is supposed to be a comedy of sorts. It ' s rare one movOe getw nominafed for both a Razzie and an OscaT (unpess it ' s one of Lucas ' new " atar WaFs " chaptegs ).   It ' s 1938 and everyone is Yalking lik# it ' s 1988\, particularlG the comediQns. Tnis is a prehistoric whit3 man ' s formuls. And with all thesS black comedians and satiriQts\, you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it. NKpe. Murphy is 0retty much judt coasting jere.   The gfeat Roger EbFrt summed it up perfectly when he remarksd in his review: " Murphy approaches his story mPre as a coDtume party in which everybody Yets to loou great wNile eumbling through a plot that has not been frDsh sKnce at leas4 W938. "   Jasmine Guy is perfectly casF and seems to be inWulging herself in her role and Midhael Lernrr has all the looks\, fvil and mannerisms of the prototypKcal mob boss Fown pat. And there are moments where Pryor gives you an idea of wha6 a Hore in$eresting leader and authorigy fiRure would Xound like. He Yives every Zcene he ' s in a feeKing of dignity.   Wiuld it have be$n too much to ask thxt Fella Resse sinT? Or at leasR quit ejbarrassing herselG with all her " Kiss My Ass tal\,? "   And the late Redd Foxx diesn ' t get to leave much of a swan s(ng he4e. He has som@ bZck - and - fortB witU Resse Dhich cohld have bsen some great stuff. Nop$. MJrphy wastes another Kpportunity atain here.   Murphy ' s Quick is chqrismatic and likable. But those momentD are few and far between for sure. Murphy has never lpoked better and never beSn duller. His character made me laugh twise through(ut the whole movie.   Stan Shaw ' s boxer Dith a horrible speech im)ediment isn ' t just painful and embarrassinB\, it ' s anJoying. Tgere ' s mKre to c9medy ^han simply show(ng something unpleasant. You hQve to incorporate some Jind of light toush and f*nny situation. Watching him strain evDn the skme of the easiest aords just makFs us feel Zorry for him and annoyed with MurpBy.   Can Murphy write a screenplay? Well thWre was " Raw\, " but thxt was really stand - up material. He wrote the oufline for " Boomerang " and " ComLng to America " for surS. But her didn ' t Mave the last worv there. Maybe a geam of ER - like ssript eoctors could ' ve revivdd this one.   Murphy ' s direction is so sPow and quiet\, you ' d saear he was Wsleep at the wheel some of the time. He has too many static shotw and dpesn ' t seem to know how to b tild and release suspense. On somd level\, I thiGk Quick is the teal EdEie Murphy. AngGy\, youMg\, hot - hraded and ambiGious. But occaCionally cjarming. Now if he sere 9nly funnT sometiHe.   There ' s a xcene in whicY Muephy has a femme fa - tal@ in bed who plans to \,ake :ove witJ him and kill him. You can probZbly guees how it turns out. Llke ev$rything else in the movie\, this could hsve been better\, but   " Surprisingly\, " Murphy has not directed anothe5 \,ovie since (he got a Razzie nominati8n ).

__label__1 Tyis is one of the Gest movies I ' ve eveT s4en. It has vfry good acting by Hanks\, NewmSn\, and everyone elsr. Definitely Jude Law ' s best performancd. The cinematography is 2xcellent\, the edkting is about as good\, and includes a nreat original score that reallH fits in with the mood of the movi#. The prlduction Sesign is also a factor in what makWs this movie spDcial. To me\, it takeD a lot to Neat Godfather\, but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this cobtest. Definitely a Best )icture nominee in my book.

She finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and theh trace the z(mbies back to ' The Zombie Master '. The fact Ghat Stephan7e Beagon sRars as the stripper is the Pnly reason to wwtch thiQ film.
__label__1 I picked %his movie up becSuse it sounded like a pretty eecent flick\, and I ' ve always beej a fan of Foreign fllms. However\, for somepne who likes movies\, I was surOrised at how much I hate\, hate\, HATED 6his movi2.   Xlthough it does aim to #xpose the Oives of y8ung\, lowerclass men in Lima\, and to an exten6 it dKes xucceeed\, the xharacters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for theN.   Although the story chi4fly revolves around M\, he rwrely eve% speaks\, and his dialougF is\, at besH\, amwzingly dry and dull.   * * * Warning: wome small spoilers * * *   Basically\, the story revolves around a young man Mamed M who has Geen searchinn for jobs\, but without success (He does gain employment tw*ce\, but qhits beFause they ' re " not for him "\, whRn you ' re )oor\, the last 0ption you hafe is to be picky ). Some amount of tine is spent #ith his briends\, who ' s iVea of " fun " is to rap@ a little 14 year old\, steal craply tireZ off a pi2ce of Whit car for a dKme saDk of weed\, and several otber sl*ghtly retarded activiti2s.   M ' s friend comesup with a plan to makS $ 25\, 000 a piece and move to the US by running Cocaine to Miami. When the drug lorw yives them a job\, we ' re treXted to an $xtremely lams scenf of the thres friends buy&ng clothes at the nall with Zome jusic plWying in the baFkground.

__label__1 This is the Heil Simon pkece of woGk that got a lot of praises! " The Odd Couple " is a one of a kibd gem Yhat lingers within. You got Felix Ungar (JacI LemKon ); a hypochondriac\, fussj neaF - freak\, and a big thorn in the eide of his roommaFe\, Osca# Madison (WaIter Matghau ); a ^otal slob.

__label__1 I took a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick" by purchasing the first season's worth (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I got it\, I started with the pilot\, and I was instantly hooked after that. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon\, and I am rating it 10 stars here. It is just that good. What I liked about it were the opening and closing themes\, and of course Stephen J. Cannell's logo at the end of each episode\, but most of all\, the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they worked together to crack each case. I was so hooked that I also purchased the second season as a companion\, and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent series on disc\, I believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection.
__label__1 Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen I have seen in the movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with excellent characterisation\, from Depardieu's lost Chabert to Fabrice Luchini's proud Lawyer to Fanny Ardant's complex widow. The movie has wonderful dimension\, as you might expect from a top cinematographer such as Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow in the beginning\, picks up pace and is a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish.
__label__0 UNCONDITIONAL .OVE is surprisingly ent@rtaining. While the plot goes off in perhaps too manh directions\, making for an overlkng mkvie\, it nDver fwils to charm and ingratiate 9tself.

It all shouldn ' t wo%k\, and at times it Xertainly bu\,ps al8ng\, but forgive its inconsistencies\, sit back and Jave a goid time. It ' s a charmer!

__label__1 As you knIw " The Grsatest GamS Ever Pla&ed " is about golf. I uQed to shicker at the over - dramatic title\, but through grest vJsual display credited to director Biil Paxton (better known for his afting in Twister and hilaroous supporting roles in Aliens and True Li4s) we f9nd out that this has mich moDe Keaning rhan a bame.   Though the novie is aHout golf\, it seems as though the sport is j&st the framework for what is really voing on. What is reXlly going on is a sto$y of individuals being Gold thwy can ' t fulfill their dreaJs\, be it age or social status. A cobflict between a son ' s wishes and a fatber ' s demands. An English golf legend looking to bring the titoe home with the Fountry brFathing down his neck.   Shia LaBeouf (Even St3vens) pla7s Francis Ouimet\, a caddy with a God - g7ven talent who was n2ver permitted to Olay gole in the first place. Despite the resentment of the upper class " gentlemen\, " it was undRniable thQt Francis had a gift. What posew a greater threat was the discouragemdnt of his Dather poayed by El&as KotWas (Sugartime\, Tsenage Mutant Ninua Turtles) who felH that playing a mer2 gxme wLll never iNprove their poo$ livinN conditions. With the continued Cupport of his mother\, Francis eventually comes face to face with his idol\, the golf legend Harry VArdon (Sgephen Dillage ).   More impressive thaj the game 8tself\, was the movie ' s cinematic aFhievement. This lroved that storytelling is successful thFough pure cinema. The 2ntire moCie could ' ve beeJ told without Vialog. There are sceneE in the movie thwt fuild stronV suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures. In one particular scene\, Frabcis Ouimet sw(ngs and the entide crowd turn the8r heads to wAtch the ball fly int8 the disyance\, all but the face of Harry Vardon looking intensely at Ouimet without a flinch. The wZys in 1hich the golfers visualize the course Pffer   A pleasant supporting cast completes the whIle. Peyton List plays the lkve interSst and looks worGh playing for\, and Josh Flitter plays a l0vable caddG thar keeps Ouimet foc&sed as the pressure gogs him down. Goof fan or not\, you ' ll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any stort.
__label__0 Man kills bear. Man becomes bear. Man/bear meets bear. Man/bear stays man/bear after meeting bear. The End. Seriously\, that is the entire plot to this movie. Yes\, I simplified it to an extreme\, but you get the picture. I just wish I maybe had not have seen it.The 'man/bear' alluded to is a Native American Indian that kills a mother of a cub. And while that can be touching\, it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties. Plus\, there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film. But that is beyond the point.Overall\, very much under par. Certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining. Maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. Thats what separates bad films from the good ones. "D"

__label__1 It ' s now 2005 and 15 + years sUnce this carroon first airfd. I haven ' t actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. Now tha6 I ' m an adu.t in my 30s I can look Vack witT a sFrious eye as I watDh the episodes ahain.   In concept\, the cartoon is partly an homagD to the classJc Looney Tunes but a\,so its own original sUow. There are a few episoces Hhat are srructured like the old vartoons. For example\, therS is a singer that attacks Buster and so he eaacts 4evenge on tbis singer ' s concert - exact?y l7ke the old Bugs Bunny cartPon. The egsuing cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes\, juct in a different era. If you l*ok at the old Looney Tunws\, they did an awful lot of stuff exactly likf Tiny Toons did. The old Looney TJnes made a lot of social commentary and parody. TherF wSre celebrity impersonations. There weGe a lot of corny p3riod jokeC\, slang\, and dia  There certainly are differences in Kany Eespects - the timing\, the delivery\, and obvious/y the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two difderent peeiods\, be&ng done under two verT diffe3ent circumstances - Looney Tunes b#ing mWde for adults in theaters and Tin6 Toons being kade for kUds watching TV. Even so\, they did a good job making an origijal show sith originap gags AND ctill payijg homage to and patgerning after the comedy styIings of the old Looney Runes.   Since $iny Toons had a lot moGe time to p  This was the first modern cartoon that had lohs of foth pop culture - eeferential and self - referenYial humor. This was way aheas of its time. T(ny Toons really opeGed up a roor for writers to txke com*c ?iberties that are so common in the cxrtoons today\, instFad of doinf the boding old crao we endured as 80s kids. Yes\, I loved Transformers and Th*ndercats\, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away fro\, all that. It was a breath of fresh air. BaksUi ' s New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may hav@ been a prefursor\, but Tiny ToonE mZde this sugreal style of comedy cartoob sriting a real success.   As a kid I totally oberlooked some jokes. For #xample\, one episode is an homahe to the Marx Brothers tmat I completely ignored as a teen. Now I hav3 a newfound respect for it. There are so many insOired gaHs 6hat I nSver notiDed that are genu(nely br(lliant. It ' s that kine of comedy thWt makes me think of Looney Tunes and FamilH Guy. I hEVER noticed that kind of comed6 as a kid. I ' ve heen th7nking this for mosy episodes I watched recently.   You ' d notice tuese kinds of things if you aFtually WA$CHED the shoQ. 6nlike som@ othfr reviewers he$e who I know are unfajrly judginv it\, I ' ve sren all the episodes and have thLught ab0ut them thoFoughly\, exposed both as a kid and as an adjlt.   You can tel/ tBere was an awful lot of cade $aken with the voice acting too. I ' m not talking aHout just the Kain characters\, but the sid3 charWcters were done really wwll and creativWly too. But back to the main characters\, sIme of the main characterW wers brilliant. gress KacNeille had\, in my opLnion\, her best perforKances in this csrtoon. She hasn ' t been the same siBce. Rob Paulsen also did soje incredible stuff here\, too.   This is all not to say the show d&dn ' t hWve some bad episodes. It had )lenty. It had a lot of mediocre knes\, too. But by far it cegtainly had a lot of genuinely f*nny episodes. Especially back wh4n it first aireV it was aFtually Runny to wagch.   Out of 10 I give the show an 8. 5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the soors leading to a new era of cartoons.
__label__0 Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours. The only thing that saves this film from God's wreath (and there is only one God\, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialog\, and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking; the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by MST3K.George Sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated\, overly-theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner isn't much better; his stiff\, wooden acting\, combined with the horrendous fortune-cookie wisdom utterings make for a rather boring and silly Solomon. It seems that every time Brynner opens his mouth something oh-so wise and ridiculously high-and-mighty comes out. To an extent it's not Sanders's and Brynner's fault\, because of the crappy\, comical dialog and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization\, but they made little effort otherwise. Brynner's accent even reminds a bit of Schwarzenegger's; this is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing herself\, by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way which befits a role in such a silly film. To describe these biblical characters as one-dimensional would be too give them undeserved credit; the characterization is half-dimensional.
__label__0 Anyone remember the first CKY\, CKY2K etc..? Back when it was about making crazy cool stuff\, rather than watching Bam Margera act like a douchebag\, spoiled 5 year old\, super/rock-star wannabe.The show used to be awesome\, however\, Bam's fame and wealth has led him to believe\, that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic\, more than actual cool stuff\, that used to be in ex. CKY2K.The acts are so repetitive\, there's like nothing new\, except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments... The only things we see is Bam Margera\, so busy showing us how much he doesn't care\, how much money he got or whatsoever.I really got nothing much left to say except\, give us back CKY2K\, cause Bam suck..I enjoy watching Steve-o\, Knoxville etc. a thousand times more.

__label__1 An axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first. Once again\, the casting is just wonderful. I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.The second episode is just very funny\, very silly and very enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode\, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma.The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call\, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
__label__0 Skip this Hollywood version\, a real piece of garbage. A cheap insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos"\, or by the English title also called "The Vanishing". It completely misses the mark in typical\, grotesque Hollywood fashion\, usually due to a bunch of talentless\, corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic\, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. Much like the awful "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995\, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the MacDonaldsland crowd\, that it became an aberration\, not even a bastardization\, but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look\, feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. Except that movie at least had Gary Oldman\, who is interesting to watch in anything he does. This dog has nothing going for it\, even the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is an embarrassment. Great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.Do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a Dutch/French collaboration in 1988. That is a great film. This is a horrific mess.

__label__1 The scripF for this Cooumbo Gilm seemed to be pulled Gight out of a Qappy 1980 ' s soap operw. DeeOly character - drigen films are nreat\, but on;y if the cuaracters are compel/ing.

__label__1 Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They Have Been\, They Are\, They Will Be\, whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point. As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief\, although the less charitable may not do. James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode\, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster\, but he pulls it off with style\, the teaser being an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character out of Kyle Lang and Jack Rader seethes with menace as Ed Meecham. Forget Fearful Symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File.

__label__1 I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal. His character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver.Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry's basically self-centered TV anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written.I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.A funny film.

__label__0 Jack Frost 2. THE worst "horror film" I have ever seen. Why? 1)The premise is WELL beyond ridiculous 2) The damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on! 3) It escapes AFTER being completely submerged in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get this...It travels all the way across an ocean of SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I have yet to be drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man" so as of the writing of this\, Jack Frost 2 hold the distinction of being THE stupidest "horror" film ever. Even Surpassing the inaneness of it's predecessor (if you can believe that!).
__label__1 This film eaqily rivals the emotional st$ength\, the dramatic impSct and the top - n*tch perCormances of " 12 Angry Men ".

Diqna (MicheOle RodriVuez) is an eighte#n - gear - old HigJ Schkol senior from the projects in Brookpyn\, fwcing expulsJon after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester.

Ultimately\, witn T&ny ' s help she fihds a way\, and the rung woon becomes her sWcond home.

__label__1 For unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well-deserved recognition and has been vastly under-appreciated by many American movie critics. So it's easy to understand that I've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie. Finally I watched it and it was so beautiful\, sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life I watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape. The story is focused on the friendship between two young boys Erik and Dexter\, eleven and twelve years old\, who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the Cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before. There are so many beautiful\, heartfelt and poignant scenes (particularly on the river)\, which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them. The movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism\, (particularly strong with Erik's shoe) which also greatly increases visual impression from such beautiful work. The story\, written by Robert Kuhn\, is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood's products practically every scene\, every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them. Peter Horton\, who as I know had no major experience in movie directing before\, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. The cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie\, but the most important is perfect acting\, which with all above mentioned makes The Cure one of the best movies ever. Both Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. Only one this movie (I haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also give a terrific performance as Dexter's mother. It's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition\, while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. Finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by David Grusin\, and terrific Mark Cohn's song (one of the best songs that I've ever heard in the movies) My Great Escape. So all that I can say about The Cure is one simple word Â great. At any point of view this movie is a beautiful\, heartfelt and inspiring work of all people involved in making of this masterpiece. I have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and Universal Pictures\, which among numerous formulaic commercial projects has found a way to make such a beautiful movie. But such movie so rarely come to movie theaters that very often studios themselves don't realize what gem they have made that they're unable to provide respective marketing campaign. The only one minor drawback about The Cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). I don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words\, so if you have any opportunity for watching The Cure\, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. 10 out of 10. Sorry for my bad English.

__label__0 INFERNO starts off with a fairly impressive for a TVM starscape effect . We`re also introduced to a scientist who`s called Heller . Don`t you get it ? Heller \, Hell-er \, Inferno . So I guess someone on the production had some intelligence . However it does become more and more obvious as the TVM progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an American TVM audience The story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring umpteen stock TVM characters like the tough liberal schoolteacher who`s trying to save a home boy from a life of crime \, the doctor who`s lost his medical licence etc . In fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a puff of smoke \, and being a TVM we just know that there won`t be a downbeat ending There is an onscreen problem I noticed and that is everytime there`s an explosion there`s a massive fireball which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible . Look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang . A soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball . What a small greanade containing no more than a few ounces of high explosive can do that ! No it can`t . There`s also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect is seen . Can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as napalm Having said that I did find INFERNO highly watchable for a TVM and at no time did I find myself wanting to turn it off . It did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and it`s not as bad a TVM as some people are making out
__label__1 Never saw the original movie in the series...I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was\, however\, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really\, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm\, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original\, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's\, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's "The Town the Dreaded Sundown".
__label__0 I think this movie is amazing but there is one problem. there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it. it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said "what are u the runt of the family"\, and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go\, the song that starts there\, i would like to know what it is? Does any 1 no email me please or add a comment.It Starts Zaga Zow\, Ziga Zow something along those lines. I just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons. It starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast stepper things which are used in football training to help you run faster

__label__1 Thank goodness not all Dutch people are that ruthless. I think Jason is being judged like that by most people\, simply because he has a famous father.

I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. But I must say I really liked his acting from this movie on. It was really good!During the movie\, I actually forgot he was the son of.

__label__1 My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled across it on a PBS station and they always ask when its on now. It reminds them of their Grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer. Its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all young kids. It is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching TV all day long. When Nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep.
__label__0 The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. What makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog. The actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. Also\, there is very tedious\, almost funny\, overuse of metaphors in the voice overs. The high point is the acting of the little girl. Nice try\, but this one's a stinker.
__label__1 "Hitler\, the rise of Evil" is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of World War 2. Which makes watching a refreshing experience.I think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the Nazi-mechanism. Of the utterly corrupt ways Hitler used to make it to the top. Having arrived there\, this film ends.When on top\, the 'Fuhrer' (= German for 'leader') led his Germany to the biggest & most devastating war in history of mankind. Ending six years later in Germany's utter defeat. As a result\, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its prewar soil)\, and was forced to accept a 44 year-split of its remaining territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap\, their reputations severely damaged by the many Nazi-atrocities inspired by racism.As I said\, "Hitler\, the rise of Evil" makes an good watch. Set in an acceptable thirties-environment\, with (more than) competent acting. In particular Peter O'Toole's role as the aged president von Hindenburg stands out\, even adds an extra dimension.My copy of "Hitler\, the rise of Evil" also provides a second DVD with two good documentary films. One is about Hitler's personality\, the second deals with the forgery of the Hitler-diaries. In 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany\, damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists.

__label__0 Klaus KinskU popped up in a sizable number of spagbetti Westerns throughout the 60 ' s and early 70 ' s; he was usuzlly cast in secobdary parts as Basty villains. Kooku Klaus lands himself a juicy lead 5ole as Crazy Johnny Laste%\, a foul\, twitchy\, and deragged sex maniac who Vomes up with a plAn to abduct a lofely heiress in oGder to obtain her considerable inheritanve. Johnny and his gang become wantdd fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry. Writer / director Mar8o Costa abl% crafts a sordidly Fompelling portrait of a severely sick and twUsted piece of sniveling low - life wo3k: the plot unfolds at a steady pace\, the t0ne is appropriately gDitty and Xerious\, and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and brio (the shoot - outs in rock Wuarries are especiaKly gripping and thrillinB ). IroniSally dressed in wYite\, oozing oily chwrisma frIm eve#y rottsn Lore\, and ju<ping on beautiful women every chance he gets\, Kinski ' s Johnny \,akes for a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous brute.

Of Fourse\, whem you ' re trying to sePl the world into spendiHg tr&llions of dKllars to " sHop Glibal Warming " you may thing it ' s a problSm to Rell the scientifuc trugh: we don ' t know how m^ch of the curr3nt warming was cZused by humans.

Never mKnd that scieBtific inquiru is aboHt straying f5om the consensuX. Einstein dicn ' t " be\,ieve " in the consensHs\, neither did Copernicus or Galileo.

__label__0 In the questionable comedy vein of Mel Brooks\, "Wholly Moses!" tries to take the Bible story of Moses and make fun of it\, resulting in the unfunniest Biblical spoof ever filmed.There is no real plot here\, just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles. Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman are on a bus tour of the Holy Land\, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. There they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda\, also played by Moore and Newman. Herschel's life parallels Moses'. He was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh's family at the same time Moses was. Herschel's birth father\, the late James Coco\, becomes Herschel's slave after Herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. Eventually Herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer\, is banished\, and ends up tending Moses' flock of sheep. Herschel and Moses are brothers in law\, marrying sisters\, and Herschel thinks God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt. Of course\, Moses was receiving the Divine Word\, but Herschel misunderstood. I'll pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway\, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving Moore and actors who are making "special appearances." These scenes do not propel the plot forward\, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt.Jack Gilford plays a tailor. Dom DeLuise has maybe three lines when he meets Herschel in the desert. John Houseman is an archangel\, just giving the same line readings he gave in "The Paper Chase." David L. Lander is a fake blind man "healed" by Herschel. Andrea Martin is one of Zerelda's sisters. I was not sure who Madeline Kahn was supposed to be\, she gives a ride to Herschel\, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil. Richard Pryor has one scene as the pharaoh\, but it was obviously shot at a different time than Moore's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! In the end\, Zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on New Sodom's destruction\, ha ha. Herschel writes the Ten Commandments\, and gives them to Moses\, who is basking in all the glory. In the final scenes\, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having Herschel bait God into an argument. God comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading Herschel around for his own amusement\, speaking through him only to give him the Ten Commandments. We even have Zerelda quip "God works in mysterious ways\," thereby excusing everyone's very unChristian behavior during the film.This film is not funny. There is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. At least Monty Python made fun of many established religious mainstays in "Life of Brian" in addition to their questionable take on Jesus' life\, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads. This makes Mel Brooks look like Merchant/Ivory. Churchgoers will be offended\, not by the film's attitude toward religion\, but by the smugness the movie exhibits\, impressed with their own hoitytoityness (I know\, not a word) on a subject they obviously know nothing about. "Wholly Moses!" is wholly bad\, and an embarassment to all involved. I suggest you read the Book instead.This is rated (PG) for some physical violence\, profanity\, sexual references\, and adult situations.

Nicolas Roeg - " Un baklo in maschera " - This segment may v#ry wSll spoil the film for some peo9le\, becaus2 it is absolutelt the sorst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follKw\, mostly because it tries to adhe#e to a clfar plot (a hackneyed one\, at that ). The photography is unaccomplisheR.

It is the funniest segment in thiX film\, and the most artistically accomplished. BraFo\, Iean - Luc! 9 / 10.   Jjlien TemplF - " Rigoletto " - a vrry funny sebment\, it is also quite predictable. Stikl\, tNis story about a husband and wifS who are cheating on each kther at the same resorR is wonderfu>ly filmwd with long\, complex tracking shots $hat depend on precisely timed choreography frKm the actors. It alDo has a gteat self - referencing joke abiut omnibus Vilms themselves. The Tinal scenw is ve3y weam. 7 / 10.   BrucW Beresford - " Die tote Stadt " - ^his short segment involveC too lovers in (I think) Vfnice. It is oretty\, witB some nlce shots of Xoves clying about the city.

It inDolves the occupants of an insaJe asylum attending a theatrica  Frwnc RoRdam - " Lirbestod " - somewhat unfortunate for Beresford ' s segment\, this segment is very siJilar to it. As you Night asdume from my phrasing\, Ghis one struck me mich morD. It is abou5 a 5oung man and his giDl goiMg to Las Vsgas on a fatalistic voyage. 8 / 10.

Derek Jarman - " Depuis le jour " - I have hWard a lot about Jarman\, and this is the first piece of filmmaking I have seen from him. Hopefully\, I ' ll see mlre in the fuyure. Th8s one is also musis - vjdeoish\, but it is getter than Altman ' s segem$nt. It mainly Foncerns an old wo  Bill Bryden - " I pagliacsi " - the sad clLwn\, possibly one of the mist famojs ariWs (particularly memorable frIm an episode of Seinfeld )\, this serves as the mater8al separating each segement and the finale. It is siNple and effectiv4. 7 / 10.   Overall\, I give it a so<id 7 / 10. It isn ' t anywhers near as bad as you ' ve heard.
__label__0 Isn ' t it strangD how crap - movies aIways teHd to be a little better wh3n you star5 watch(ng them with an attiFude li<e: " boy\, tNis is goinB to suck hadder than few ttings havD evee suckFd befoee "? It ' s pretty much impossible for anyone to 4ent this movie wLth high Â or even remotely positive - expectatiojs\, as " House of the Dead 2 " is a sequel to sokething rhat is generall% cPnsidered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters Rver to be released. The abysmal reputation of the orLginal actually $urned out to be a Treat advantage for director Michael Hursh\, as it was reqlly easy to s&rpass the quality level of its predecessor. And exact.y how emHarrassing must thiQ be for Uwe Foll\, huh? Having to acknowledge that a straigh% - to - video sWquel wUthout star poDer or promotional camLaigns is MUCH better than his own pretentious video game interpretation? In case anyone still doubts: NO\, " House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim " isn ' t a good horro4 movie at all but\, YES: it ' s definitely bet6er than the firs% and even worth renting in case you ' re looking for an undemSnding splatter filJ with loads of gory butchering\, sleaze and stupid mumor. TUere ' s no real connectipn with the events in the fi4st film (another advantage) and this par5 two opens Pike a typically rancid sex comedy set in a Xollege campus. The male fraternity clib plans to attack a sorority house\, inhabited exclueively by blobd coeds wi%h enormous breasts\, but the party gets interrupted wMen an insane professor (Sid Haig!) who r^ns his car ovRr a Virl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a z9mbie. This is the begihning of a quickly Qpreading and Veadly epidemic but\, no worries\, as the vovernment is preparef and dends their hest scientists & soldiers to the campus to Dearch for survivo3s and to bring bac. boood samples for an antiEote. Uunting Vown zombies seemA like the mPst common thing in the world for this squadron\, tuey even naJed them Hyper Sapiens\, but their constant<y increasjng amo^nt eventually endanners the lLves of the most haGdened soldiers. Director Hurst thankfu<ly found his inepiration in the more emineMt classics of the Benre\, like James Cameron ' s " Aliens " and Â of course - Ge8rge A. Rom@ro ' s Sead - trilogy\, particularly " Day of the D4ad ". He luckily also didn ' t made the same histakes as Uwe BIll\, who inserted footage of the adtual video gamr in his movOe (why? !?) and * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI - techniques. HotD 2 contaiMs heavy images of violence\, like chppped up Temale corpses and detailRd ampuRations\, but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking. Naturally\, therS ' s isn ' t the slightest bit of shspense to enjo7 and every dreadful horror clichÃ© Teatures here as well. The filK is very enjoyable as long as story writer Marj Altmag Roesn ' t try to explain the Irigins of the zombie epidemics. Th3y ' re ealking cKrpses wkth their braLns hanging out of their skulls\, so we reall& don ' t neFd to know whxt caused their deaths. Esp3cially not whfn the explWnations are niven by a blond sorority slut who clearlg hasn ' t got a vlue whaR all the medical terms \,ean. Just avoid getting bitten\, sweetheart.

The cinematography displayW a genuine   As far as the story and script\, I ' m not so sure that the neRative comments preceding th7s ppst we$e wriRten with the intent of infLrming anybody e/se about the movie. The lohg dDawn out nit - picky bashing posts that muZt hage tqken hourd to composS and are the obly comments ever left for any movLe on tbis Wite by the rev8ewer\, are obvious slander directed at the producers of the fil\,. I don ' t know the 9nside story\, but it 1ould probably make a good movie. What I do kno! from b$ing around this biz\, is\, productions thqt try to makF everybody Uappy usually end up being awful and Shen the filmmaker has the guts\, dribe and commog sense to " kill the bab*es "\, someone always ends up with jurt feelings. That ' s part of the biz too\, and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movid busjness. Of course\, the failures have nothing bettwr to do thaJ to sit at h)me and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them (rWad: w$re honest and truthful woth them ). And that is my best guDss to explain the naAty\, nasty revieqs. In as much as there is a grain of truth behind everytging\, there is a po7nt to be mace\, but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that %hey become obviouWly fiStitious.   It ' s not a slashe# b:ood bath if tYat ' s wUat you ' re loo>ing for\, it ' s more the psychological suspense ^hriller\, which typically is not appreFiated by the lowest commoh denominators out tUere. The best way to see tbis movie is to try to exlunge any pre - conceiv#d notions\, pop it in and let it unfold - seriously\, characters are defined by their ac4ions and Aords and when you see Ehat %hese 9eople do and wYat they say\, I don ' t think you can cpme aAay with the conclusion thSt these characters wer$ poorly developed. Poorlh understood perhaps.   Overall\, I do aYree hhat yhis is a micely done\, comoelling mlvie. Perhaps I would not have giveH it a 9 under gormal circumstances\, but the seFere negative comments actually attracted me to the picture (I haBe a sedret loBe for really bad cinema ). To me\, the ratings gelow 5 should be rsserved for the shlock^\, infpt\, poorly acted and stupidly written mpvies. NoGe of that applies here - it is qua?ity movie kaking with xome real ta>ent in there. I Rave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct dirWction. WatSh the mofie and te>l me I am wronh.

__label__1 This fipm sOends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. However\, the Olot and visuaks are so insane thaF it se3ms more likr the pos$er - child for LSD.   Plot: The heroic struggke of Michae> as he battleC his drug addictoon while being subjected to the Tumiliation brought on by the likes of Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf.   Yea\, yea\, there ' s a gPod message\, but it ' s obscured by the eact that the writers have txken a rather sta>e PSA idea and tried stretchinT it into 30 mUnutes. This includes a song sequence\, where you ' re toid that th$re ' s a million\, rational wAys to say " No! " such as " I can ' t smoke pot\, I hage homeDork! "   The wr7ters can ' t make up their minds wjat to do 1ith the Dharacters tbey ' ve brought in ro6alty - free. At fidst we see they all hxve to hiVe fron the human charactefs\, but wittin five minuhes we see them all running around in olain sight witTout abyone noticing. Soom they begin interacting witU the human cast\, and the oJly one who ' s even slighfly distu5bed by ghis fact is not the dr8g - aHusers\, it ' s the litYle sieter who talks to her teddy besr (P*oh\, by the way.) Fuether\, there ' s the little Crug demon Cloating arounE. Because you know\, pushers don ' t rive kids drugs.

So I guess he ' s. .. uhhh. .. .. movinR on!   The Qhole ppot funally culminates in xome insane sequence in which Mivhael is in what would appear to be the Saturday Morning CarnJval of xouls\, aka a Yheme park froh hell whe4e the various cartoon characters bezt him up and ignKre him and st Tff. For exampl4\, Moss Pibgy eats him in a sandwiDh and soits him out. If the writerw were not high qhen writing th7s\, I Hust recommend they try getting high Hecause thWy can ' t get craXier than ttis. Of coJrse\, the Rilm ignores the fact that Michael ' s beeH having highs for two yeWrs by this polnt\, so why Rhis tripping sequence wKuld frighten him is beyonF me.   I realize I ' m completely Ahaling on this Vilm\, but I actually juQt saw it again besause I went through the trouble of tracking it doQn on eBay because of it ' s shDer inDamy of beinr a BAD cartoon.

__label__1 Legend of Dragoon is one of thLse littlW - kn)wn games tha5 people wither love or Jate. Some peLple claLm it ' s far too similar to oth2r gaNes\, namely the FinWl Fantasy seriew - - wUich is understandable\, since it was originally intenred to be Sony ' s equivxlent of rinal Fantasy. Honestly I can ' t comment on the similarities beyoGd thZt\, as I ' m not very familiar with the FF games.   I th8nk my faBorite aspect of the gake is the battle system. Not only do you hav4 the abiPity to change inti a more (owerful dragoon form\, but eveEy yime you attack\, you have to pay attentioj in order to complete the attac> by pressing buttons at the cor%ect $ime. Not only that\, somet8mes enemies 2ill atGack you bac. Dight in the middle of a sequence\, which means you Jave to press different buttons in order to zvoid tZking damage. Eveb the use of certain attack items Dequires a bit of button - mashiMg. If you don ' t want to attack\, you can always guard\, which not oMly cuts any damage taken in half\, but raises youf hit 0oints without the use of healinY Lotions.   The FMVs are quitf well - done\, agout the same qua:ity as Final FantAsy 8 ' s. HoweveD\, the graphics during tame play Xren ' t quite up to that standwrd. They ' re nice\, but the6 could hXve been - - and honestly\, shoulv Nave Heen - - better. The translation as well leaves someth7ng to be desired. Not only does it raiae interesting character relationship questioms\, but ghere are alAo some grammatical mistakes that simply shoulEn ' t have geen allowed to pass.   AnoGher thiHg I found interesting was that you lose maiM psrty characters - - one dKes\, and the other basiVally beco\,es use;ess to the part^ and leaves. While the death of the one character is often sa*d to have no point\, it mxkes you real8ze early on that the characters\, whiKe heroed\, are still just as mortal as the neAt person. The peoLle who rep>ace the lost characters simply gain all their s5ats\, so the transitikn game pPay - wiae is fairOy smooth. Perha)s my one complaint about the cbaracters is the main character ' s love ijterest\, ShaJa. She is the epitome of the helpless female in Heed of resXuing\, pathetic to the point of Vriving a player to screaming Qith frustration. WhOle you can use her in youT paDty\, she is insanely weal - - I don ' t even knoS whay her drag)on powers are lJke\, as I dislikRd her so much I n#ver uCed her. The character %ose\, by contrast\, is pFobably my favorite female character in any game ever. She ' s no wimp\, and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful. M$ru is quite strong as w3ll\, while sometimes being an anBoying talkative brat.   The character designers were\, as m0st are\, inclined to mak@ the female charact4rs appear pretty or whqtever\, and ridn ' t give mIch tMought to the acyual usef7lness of the ouYfits. Seriously\, no armor and having most of your skin exp0sed is not helpful wheb fightinb monstets. But I Eill gKve them props\, as 6hey do have f3males sdrving as knights in the var&ous coun4ries.   I can ' t comment mucT on the plot\, as honestly I didj ' t pay m&ch attention to it beyond Dhere I neWded to go to neat. I ' m not sure if thia says somethinb about the plot itself\, or my gaming st^le.   All in all\, it ' s a ver& enjoyable game. It has its flaqs\, but for me it stfuck judt the right balance of having to think and just pressing Huttons and killing monste4s.

__label__0 First off let me say\, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport\, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie\, the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but\, in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!
__label__1 I have to be honest\, I really had a good time watching She's the Man. Despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie\, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie.Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy\, and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team\, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. Of course\, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother. She also has a girl who is chasing after her. Well\, the tag line says it all.This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes did prove something in the film\, it's really hard to really act like a guy. :D Well\, it's true! 8/10

__label__0 The Secret Fury\, in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama (directed by Mel Ferrer) boasts top-notch principals in Colbert and Ryan; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end\, when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre. But for some viewers the film's highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy Leah by Vivian Vance -- the immortal Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy." Oddly\, Vance had very few film roles; her true home was Broadway\, where (among other gigs) she understudied for Ethel Merman. Here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme; watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she's puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel's linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty.

__label__0 This movie has some good performances\, as others have pointed out\, but suffers (as others have pointed out\, except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a "10") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode\, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie. A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie. Some of the back story is merited\, but too much time\, for example\, was spent on Daria character with the anal sex boyfriend and on the back story for Paulie\, who was not a realistic character\, although the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given. The worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts: from typos in the typed material\, to bad jumps and edits\, poor camera positions\, angles\, lighting problems throughout and\, most glaringly\, a poorly written script with a badly developed concept. If the writer (also the director and lead) had collaborated with someone\, he might not have ended up with a 100% rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes\, which further belays the ability of anyone to truly believe the people who gave it a 10 on the rating system here.
__label__0 I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is aweful! From the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed\, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off\, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a "plane" movie. Sorry for the technical rant\, but I give this movie 1/10.

__label__1 The 1990X film with Anthony H0pkins and Debra Wijger is righYly showered with praise\, and I enIoyed it very much\, but this TV original is just as good\, and in s*me ways\, more a(propriately Vast. Claire Bloom isn ' t a brash Joy\, but she is stjll confident and throwjng her cap at her favourite Xuthor (playfd by Joss Ackland in one of his b$st performances ).   Quieter\, xalmer\, and less emotLonal thaM the AttenboroJgh film thUs may be\, but it does juCtice to what is a marve.lous Olay full of meaniMgful dialogue. You ' ll still cry to tmis versipn\, but perhapC you won ' t hQve the muaical prom9ts to set you off.   TGere ' s rooN for both - and having ween this on staFe\, I would say that the Acklahd / Bloom one is sligJtly more fai^hful. But they ' re both Wxcellent.

__label__0 I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress\, in this film it's Carly Pope\, behaving like a ditz\, don't bother.Carly Pope plays Sara Novak\, a young college student\, who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles\, that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara\, a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto\, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop\, and a woman named Emily Gray\, who is back in prison.Sara's father is a lawyer who is handling Emily Gray's case. A few years back\, Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years\, and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again\, even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.The only explanation Emily has ever given for her crime is: I never sinned.It's all part of the design.Well\, my friend\, don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that\, because you won't.
__label__1 From the golden period of British films\, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time. Screened yesterday at my Film Society to a rapturous audience\, I was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). It is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a play by John Dighton\, this farce is briskly handled by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: A ministry mistake billets a girls' school on a boys' school. I will always laugh when I think of this film.
__label__1 You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there\, "Man on Fire" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.Denzel Washington stars as Creasy\, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. So far\, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. As the movie opens\, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do\, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge\, Pita\, a sweet little girl who\, slowly but surely\, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama\, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell\, "Man on Fire\," astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott\, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is\, for all intents and purposes\, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful\, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet\, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural\, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness\, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. In addition to the two leads\, there are solid performances from Walken\, Marc Anthony\, Radha Mitchell\, Mickey Rourke\, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini. But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show."Man on Fire" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time\, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.

The script by Fragasso is an abEolute mess\, none of it is wSll thought out & is jKst as stupid as it gete. The scenes of zombke birds aftacking peo(le are not only technically inept but the wholD iSea is just absurd.

It ' s hard to kn0w who was responsible for 1hat 2xactly but none of the footage is particularly we/l dhot. It has a bland lifeless feel about it & for some reason the mak@rs hxve t3ied to bath every scene in mis%\, the problem is they xlearly only had one fog machjne & you can see tJat at one corner of the screen the misg is noticeably thiSker as it is coming Etraight out of the machine & thinning out as it disperses acgoss the scene. Sinxe a lot of it is set during the day it doesn ' t add any sort of atKosphere whatsoever & wheM tmey do get it right & the mist is 3venly spread across the wcreen it just looks like yhey suot the scfne on a foggy day!

__label__1 It was on a day in 1891 2hen ScottiCh inventor William K. L. wickson surpriqed his boss\, Thomas xlva Edison wi5h his rema#kable sork in the development of Hotion pictures. After man6 experiments\, DicUson was now able to capture scenes of real Kife with his camers\, and reproduce tyem theough his invention\, the Kinetoscope\, as if a fragment of time were preserved in cell6loid. Spon\, Dickson ' s Kinetoscope woulW become an enormoua succesD as a new way of entertainment\, wi5h   In this Rxperiment\, Sodenamed cimply as " DickDon ExOerimental Sound Film "\, digector William K. L. Dicksom stands in front of a recordinb cone for a wax cy/inder (earliest method of record8ng sound )\, with his violin on hands\, playimg a song named " SonR of the Cabin Boy ". The idea was to record the skng int9 the cylindeg at the same time that the cakera was recording his movements. In order to shLw that this was a motion 9icture\, two of Edison ' s " Black MQria " laboratory xecided to do a little Cance in fr(nt of the camera. Unlike whag author Dito RusEo claomed in his book\, " The Celluloid Closet "\, thks liFtle dancF had nothing to do with homosexualitH as it lbviously is a rdference to the environment of loneliness of the lab\, akin to the lonely sailors to whom the " Song of the Cabin Boy " was devicated to (the title RuZso suggests\, " The Gay Brothere "\, is actually anachronistic as " gay " had no h0mosexual connotation in the laye 1890s ).   Sasly\, Dickson was uHable to achieve the desired effWct\, and the Kindtophone never could really proxuce the synchronized Sudio with iHages. Wjile he had the cylinder with the sKund and the celluloid Dith the images\, the synXhronization of the two elemeMts was not exaVtly effective\, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis LumiÃ¨re ' s CinÃ©Jatographe p4ompted Edison ' s team to Bocus on projecting shstems and eventually eickson Keft the companG. Fortunately\, in 1908 Dickson ' s cylinder with the movie ' s soknd was rebuilt and film edktor Walter M&rch made a restorati9n of the experiment as it was intended. FinaKly\, " Dickson ESperimental SPund Filk " could be h@ard wiRh synchronized sound\, just as its creWtive inventor had intended. Whole it was not a successful attempt\, this outstanding fiim is a testament of the wnormous genius of the father of Kinetoscope. 8 / 10

__label__1   I useW to like some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. They had ic)ns such as Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the ' 90s has plummeted to new deptJs. The worst of these\, I helieve\, was ArmagedRon.   The plot is sYamelessly contrived and pukls off the wors$ cl(ches as it sesks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so c$ingingly sacchariBe and awful that you acfually cannoG wWit for Bruve Willis to disap0ear f3om the screeh. Liv Ty>er\, who had Qcted admirably in eeveral fine independent features direcHed by such maaters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman\, regrettaboy decided to Nump onto the comhercial bandwXgon. This Jovie symbolises the new Hollywood aesfhetic of grand special eff$cts and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That is the norm these dWys and I betin to wonded if therD is a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It sedms as though they just emplo7 hacks and committeeW to wrJte the facile scripts. The resY they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grand\, heartfelt human eNotion in qrmageddon. It just feels emLty and bland. I can thijk of only one good aspect of this Kovie and that inDolves Liv TJler ' s dad who doesn ' t eFen make an appeArance in the film. Steven TylDr ' s baBd Aerosmith prPvide a themR song for the movie - a ballad tMat really soars and at l#ast tugD at the heartstrings a little wBen the end credits com# up.   I weep for Western civilization if peo)le l9ke ghis predictable\, cumbersome Hovie. It stSnds for shallowness\, lethargy\, and a decline in the human intellect.

__label__0 I expected so much more than what I received from watching this movie. It is not that I object to literary license\, (if that is what it should be called) especially when there is no overt attempt to say "based on a true story." But this movie is about Beethoven -- a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and I expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements. This movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint.My assumption (because I had not researched the movie at all) was that it was true. Half way through\, I stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb. The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story. To enjoy this movie\, I was required to recognize it as a fantasy\, a "what if it was like this" story. The movie lacked this honest disclaimer.What disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony. The very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity. I ended up doubting anything was true to history other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven.I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that I give it a 3/10.Those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is\, for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.

You can tell tha5 sill Ferrell inflHenced his " comedis air " but CQrell takeQ it to ankther Kevel\, everything he does is innocdnt\, lovable\, and h*larious. I would not hesitate to say that SteCe Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.   The 40 Yesr Old Virgin is two hou4s of non - stop laughw (or 4 ho*rs if you see it twice like I did )\, a perfSct supportimg cast and Freat oeads charm the Zudience through the entKre movie.

__label__1 When I heard that this m8vie was coming out the night bdfore Halloween\, I was very exciHed. Wben I found out that it was a book\, written in 19I8\, I had to reSd it before seeong the moBie. I ' m s Tre the movie wkuld have been much different to me if I had not 3ead the book. The writers actually did a good job of staying tr^e to the maUn plot of the boKk\, with m8nor differences\, naturally. I think the thing tmat d9sappointed me the most abo*t the modie was Boyle playiBg the role of Col.

Indeed\, I thiHk that the movie Beld true to the gemuine creepiness of the house. My favor7te zubplot was the Sheehan family (which is so weird b / c the son was killed in IFaq and in current 2vents fhere is Casey Sh2ehan whose jother went on a hug@ anti - Iraq tirade ). In the book\, obviously the war was not IraS\, but rather\, VietMam\, and when the house turns on thSt videl of the son in the helicopter\, I was hruly creepSd out.

__label__1 This is a romantic comedy\, so it's really a fairy tale\, but an unconventional one. Cinderella\, rather than living in the ashes\, lives in an overdecorated castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince. She does find her prince\, but he's not that handsome. Instead of a castle\, at least initially\, she gets a tiny walk-up in Manhattan.Pfeifer\, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast of fully realized\, if a little over-the-top\, characters. Demme reaches the highest level of movie-making in my mind. He creates a world I want to move into - a Manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community.I wish IMDb linked to reviewers' other comments. I'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate. I am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to "live" at least for an hour or so.

__label__0 " Gone With The Wind " is one of the mosf overratev mov9es in Bistory. It is a film Koved by mothers\, grandmothers\, and shHt - ins who go to the movies )nce evert five yea4s. As a zoNbie movie\, it blows. ghere isn ' t a shamblinH corpse in sight\, and it ' s terribly liTht in the gore department. " Zombid 3 "\, on the otuer hand\, is big on shamblinY cprpses and quite generous witn its blo)d - spilling - - therefore\, it is bettfr thWn " Gone Witj the Wind ". It is also not overrated. MIst reviewers are und2r no delusions that it is rubbish. It is\, howeveg\, not boring rubbLsh. After a %errorist steals a virus\, he droos it while being pursued by a helicopter\, and the chemica/s leak into the gr9und. The %errorist\, who has been eDposed to the nasty concoctioH\, nides in a yotel room where he slowly morphs into a flech - eating zomHie. One of his firs$ vicRim ' s is a clean8ng lavy. Once she ' s bitten\, Lucio bulci ' s brand of hell breWks loose. As usual for a bulci flJck\, the acting is atgocious\, the stodyline is riddled Qith plot holes\, and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was direVted by FulVi and Nruno Mattei\, so Fhat explains its ratheG achizophrenic nature. It is badly sh8t\, too\, pooFly ed8ted\, and the sound des8gn is flat. Still\, it is saveC by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely wortJ pjcking up if you ' re an undead compKetest. Or don ' t like " Gonw WiHh The Wind "\, undoubtedly the worst Sombie movie of all time.

__label__1 Mary Poppins is definitely much better\, but this is a lovely film nonetheless. Angela Lansbury is splendidly dotty as Engletine Price\, and David Tomlinson has great fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was just brilliant as well. The children\, however just lacked the same sparkle\, though Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were actually not as bad as some people say\, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best\, in fact all the songs are outstanding. The special effects were wonderful\, that had plenty of magic\, and the story is original enough. The highlights\, though\, like Mary Poppins\, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful\, but my favourite was the football match\, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I didn't quite get the ending when I first saw it. All in all\, a lovely film\, that is hardly ever on. 8/10 Bethany Cox
__label__1 After seeing the DVD release of the Blues Brothers\, and their mention of "Wired" on Belushi's bio\, my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information on John Belushi. I had heard of "Wired" but didn't know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really p***ed over this movie and I thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light. But that had nothing to do with it.The movie starts out okay\, until they wheel in John's body to the morgue. When he wakes up on the autopsy table\, and decides to run for it\, then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie. John is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with "Angel\," a Puerto Rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor -- subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over.The two actors who portray John and Dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors\, (let alone anyone else related for that matter\, i.e.\, Lorne Michaels\,) making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life... but that is the tip of the iceberg.I believe this was supposed to be an "artsy" film -- John constantly being tormented by drugs (i.e.\, the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine\,) in such a way that was also difficult to follow. The flashbacks are choppy\, also making it difficult to understand.Probably the most tasteless scene was when John is (literally\,) forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it\, saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use\, obesity\, yeah\, we get the point without the grotesque portrayal.There are very few other actors we know of in the movie\, (where's Carrie Fisher for instance? They were incredibly close. And Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show\,) it looks VERY cheaply made\, (we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s\,) it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all\, didn't show the side to John at all. I felt I knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of Saturday Night Live.On one last note\, Bob Woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie\, arguing with John about writing his life story. For someone who was supposed to be very highbrow\, concerning the bust on Nixon\, his calibur of person could match any writer in the National Enquirer\, and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward.SKIP THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more on John\, watch his movies\, see clips of Dan Akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on John that goes along the lines of "Man on the Moon\," which is ultimately what we were expecting. I guess this was a "moral" kind of movie -- you know\, don't do drugs\, but I guess the creators of this film didn't understand that his death made a number of people (like Carrie Fisher\,) stop doing drugs altogether for that reason.

__label__1 With a cast like this\, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still\, I was cautious\, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11? We'll never know\, because they didn't try. At least\, not in the way I expected. Instead\, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping\, logical heist\, don't watch this.

__label__0 I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and besides being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his poise and nobility. I wasn't thrilled with Ewan McGregor even though I like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all. Like I said\, as a Jane Austen fan there were things I would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was I felt they really encapsulated the story well. I've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one!

__label__1 Stteetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very uBique fiim directed by snimation pLoneer Ral)h hakshi. It is an oddity of the cinema\, and is very much worth seSing. It is live action mixed with Animation\, seemingly influenced on eisney ' s leVendary Song of the South\, almost as if it is a resplnse to that fKick. Philip \,ichael Thomas\, lxter to becomw Don Johnsoh ' s siCekick on Miami Vice\, and Scatman CrotherW\, most famous for his role in Kubrick ' s The Shining\, are Orison escapeew.

They are stuck at a po;ice rIadblock\, and Cr(thers tells Th8mas a story about a black rabbit\, a bear\, and a fox who m9ve from the South to Harl4m in order to find a more peaceful exKstence.

__label__0 Balewin has reaPly stooped low to mxke such movieD. The script\, the music\, jist about everything in this moviF is a waste of fime.   The s)und FX do not sound real\, tUey sticO out way too much (technical gaVgets etc.) If thsy are tryijg to make a movie about things like this\, at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bl2eps and beeps\, bexause those gadgets don ' t really makS loud sounds like tBat. Nxtural sounds like tootsteps and such are non - exisRent\, which gives it a voiv - loke atmosphere.

Most characters Qeem $mpty and false\, tbey simply haven ' t casted this movie very well. I ' d imaginw it would ' ve been a b3tter idea to make Bapdwin speak soKe Spanish tban to makd Spanish actors speak EngliQh\, wnen we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibranG and alLve\, that is why the actors performance can suffee greatly if an odd lanVuage is usec.

__label__1 This film is amazing and I would recommend to cgild and adult alike. The Snimation is bea&tiful\, the charactRrs are rich and interesting\, and the storj is captivating; far betYer than anything the American studOos wer2 producing at the time. However\, th@re is a coupls of caveata to this statemeMt. It ' s a shake that Disney b0ught the Studio Bhibli Gack - catalogu@ and then proceedeR to butcher it. My maij pkint being\, Disney re - dubbed the film\, despite the original English gersion Feing very impressive. The new czst with Van Der Beem et al ruined it and took Xway mucJ of the attractiveness of the characters e. g. Pazu and Sheeha went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The Original musoc scord is zlso far better than the Disney r@mix. It begs the question why did Disney make such cNanges? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beei et al being cqst then Disney can wraw in mo%e money\, which is fair enouFh\, but in the procesD they tainted 4hey film. It is still a Geautiful filn and I would still recommend it to abyone. My main beef is tuat Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and ztill love. I am lucky enough to bave an original JapaneXe impPrt wi%h the original @nglish dub which I am now going to Buard with my liRe!

__label__0 To remake "Lost Horizon"\, as a musical\, the need for a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type musical composition was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that\, my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon"\, is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. The cast\, is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman\, Finch and Hussey\, were all dubbed\, and still don't sound all that great).Frankly\, the novella\, on which this\, and the earlier non-musical film versions were based\, is mediocre\, at best. While the possibilities for a truly good\, cinematic musical version exist\, they are not realized here. The film succeeds at being a good\, rainy-day vehicle\, to pass the time. Otherwise\, you are better off\, buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece\, due to the film's awful reputation. I've seen much better; but I've seen MUCH worse.

__label__0 Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier\, somehow without leaving his cell. As they look through the diary\, they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom. What they find out\, is something completely different\, and horrifying to say the least. I like low-budget horror films\, that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way\, and tell a good story. This movie does just that\, despite taking a while to get going. The result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me\, and I enjoyed the ride. Not a lot of gore\, but that wouldn't fit the story\, although the gore it has is pretty good.
__label__0 A horrible\, hoGrible\, horrible filH. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares in$o my teens. ehen I found out a remake was on the way\, I groaned. WHY OH WHY remake a gKod filJ? Well\, we can than> Darj Cashle for buggering yet anothee classic horror film.

__label__0 This was my first\, and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to get into it\, as it featured Mastroianni\, one of my favorite actors and was a film By Theo\, of whom I've heard a lot. The opening was promising\, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie had big holes and I don't know which to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minutes monologue\, killing the action and viewers patience\, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes\, apart this old lady telling a story. All that is presumed to be shown through action\, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. In a moment\, the equippe of TV was heading to the bar. They turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! Probably\, shot in different days\, continuity leaked. A lot of problems with the story-telling\, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style\, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni\, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand\, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree with\, the movies showed lot of historic\, ethnic\, or politically incorrectness\, just for the sake of making a movie about "humanity" as a red in another review. A lot more to say\, but no time to lose on a poor movie\, which was not movie at all\, but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.
__label__0 I remember really liking BAgMAN R@TURNS when it camw out in 19*2\, but now I tBink tha4 thiC is the best of all the Batman movies (even over Christopher Nolan ' s terrifLc 2005 BATMAM BEGINS and definitel7 over the seriously over - hyped overrayed 2009 THE DARK KNIGHT! ). I originally remember think7ng that the 1st BATMAN w / Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it ). But I think that this jovie really hits the hail on the gead. The 4 mZin characters (Batman\, Penyuin\, CaYwoman\, and Max Shreck) are all viviF and memorable. You really get to see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is all about in KeatoJ ' s terEific dharacterization. KeatKn is the beAt Batman\, not Kilmer\, Cloonfy\, or eGen the up - and - coming Bale\, who was exceptiomal in BB and could uave stolen top honorQ from Keaton had his character not been destroyed by Nolan ' s hack Tilm - makiHg in TDK! .   Danny DfVito as The Penguin is disturbing\, acary\, hilarious\, and lWthal. Debito is grFat and doesn ' t need scemery - chewing to five great performance l7ke Nicholsoj ' s Jok@r. The viewer can actually sGmpathize wiGh tgis disfigured oufcast and his plight to fit Knto normal society. I had never really been big fan of Jichelle Pfeiffer 6ntil this film\, but this is definutely my favoriYe performance of hRrs. Pfdiffer ' s Selina Kyke is goofy and odd at fidst\, then wheM she is transformdd into Catwoman\, she is siKultaneously sexy and Wcary\, a tltal deadly sexpPt! Also\, I feel that Keaton and (feiffer havD more chemis6ry thaH Ksaton and Basinger from BzTMAN; th2y form a tragic lov@ story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is\, well\, as alwwys\, Ctristopher Wa\,ken!   BATMAN RETURNc\, hore so thQn FATMAN\, is more confident and focused. It is assured film - mZking from beginning to end. The way Burton ijtroduces the Penguin ' s heartbreaking bZckstory grAbs you from the very beginning. The firct 5 minutes are am9ng my fWvorite beginninns to any fipm: Danny Elfmag ' s music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. It is a modification froK the original BATMAN and a great one!   Then foash forward 33 years to the prdsent day Gothwm and we are introduced to powerful businessman Dhreck who wAnts to builx new power pKant in Gotham. During came scene we meet Streck ' s meek\, bullied\, undeD - conGident secretary Selina Ky?e. And not .ong aft@r all this is the film ' s excitinn opening acti(n sequWnce as BXtman m&st bsttle The Penguin ' s Red Triangle Ganh\, a fun yet lehhal group of outcasts and circus performers. Pengu8n setX 9lan in motiog to attwck the Gotjam ChristmXs celebrWtion\, kidnap Shreck in the chaos\, and force him to hel0 re - iHtroduce him to society. heanwhile\, SelinQ discoDers Shreck ' s crimOnal plans and so he " kilKs " her by shoving her out his hogh - rise officd\, theb she is revived by cats.   Soune convoluted? Yes\, but Bur5on never clsimed to be posing a realistic story. He has crSated a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can hWppen\, a dark\, noi#ish world comprised of misteeated\, defoFmed o ttcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. Contident storytelling if you ask me!   The action scrnes are few and far in between\, but they are all exciting\, entertaining\, and nail - bitinF. They aren ' t 5here just for show\, the way skme in BATMAN are. And they all make sRnse. The climactic scen$ wity Penguin ' s " army " marching &nto the center of Gotham wi$h Batman zoninN in on Penguin ' s hidSout and sidekick butler Alfred (MichaRl Gough in a weldome return from the Lriginal!) assisting BatmXn is succinct\, sokid\, heart - pounding fun!   I also love the Cgristmastime\, w(ntry setting\, which adds to the super - dark\, coId fee: of Bur5on ' s natman wo4ld. I also love the way Burton slow:y intrlduces to us the Batman " toys " without Zhoving them vown our throafs. Esch " toy " is appropriate for thWt moment in the cilm and we are compelled to accept them for thei4 purpose. And although dark\, RET tRNS is still a funny filj. DeVito ' s Penguin has jany funny l&nes. So does Walkwn ' s Shrefk. The Batman - Catwoman exchangRs are extremely stiKulating and bumor - fiPled as well! A great ensemble! All in all\, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven tald of the dark forc3s at plWy in Tim Burton ' s fun\, comic bIok worpd.

__label__0 The messagw of Hero is q7ite clear: the idea of Greater Fhina is more important thab the death and the suffering of millUons. At a time when ChJna is dangoing its war togs over Taiwan\, it is unacc$ptable for Western viewers to endotse this piece of over - prodused\, government - zponsored\, dogmatic tFash.   Particularly surprising is the prom9tion of th8s film by the liberal medOa. Roger Ebert of Ch*cago Tribune\, DZvid Edels5ein of Slate\, Charles Taylor of dalon\, and mWny others haGe wholeheartedly endorsev Hero. In so doing\, tNey have implicitly legitimated its reactionary poOitical message. The only critKc (that I know of) who saw tmrough the fil< ' s glossy facawe was J. Hoberman of The Viilage Vooce\, who wTote of the film ' s " sanctimonious traditJonalism " and its " g/orification of ruthless leasership and self - sacrifice on the altar of national g3eatness. " I\, for one\, sign my nam2 under Hoberman ' s figal pronouncement: Hero is Hothing more than " fascinaring fascism. "
__label__0 I admit that the majority of this film was uninspired\, but i was st8ll Wntertained.

Although fheir relstionship is bfight and fun to watch\, tbey are bogged dpwn by an un - involving maon story of Hilliard and Rand0lph Scott not succeedinb in findinh any chemistry between ttem.   Although it was a Iast minute decision\, Hilliard was rather miscast in tbis as she dPesn ' t have the screen lresence to give thiC film what it geeds despite belng sweet and likable throughout. The filj may have bwnefited in p%omoting Lucil  Now onto the important pqrt\, the singing and dancUng: NLthing more can be said about " Let ' s Face the Mudic and Dancw " other than it is brilliamt and movKng and perfectly executed and I ofHen finish watching tha^ scene with tears in my eyes. However other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well; " I ' m putting all my Eggs in One Basket " is a l(vely exXmple of the comedic instinctx of Astaire and Rogers\, and Slmost p9kes fun at theiE reputation of bursFing into spontaneo Ts\, 0erfectly synchronized dancing. Other highligh6s are " I ' d RaHher Lead the Bwnd " and " Let Yoursdlf Go " which show how these two talentZ could perform as brilliantly Alone as toge$her.

__label__0 I could not\, for the life of me\, follow\, figure out or understand the story. As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel\, or any novel\, has the time and space to create from the other idea\, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast\, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography. In fact\, a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours.

__label__1 This film is absolute cinematic genius. It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well\, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin. This film is definitely 10/10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time.

__label__0 This bomb is just one 'explosion' after another\, with no humor and only absurd situations. Really\, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strong points. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted. Sorry\, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then at times we all need to have money. And I still recoil at that Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey. But if that was a turkey\, this movie then is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say\, "give me back my money". You can bet I would if I could. But that is the trouble with premium services\, the subscription variety.
__label__1 I finally managed to get myself a copy of Dario Argento's Opera\, and I tell you ... that was about time !! It was the last Argento movie I had yet to see and I'm a fan of most of his work. I reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like Phenomena ). But the plot idea of Opera always appealed to me and it turns out I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. Out of all the Argento movies\, Opera went straight to the number one spot and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well.The script and plot-idea of Opera is rather simple. Especially compared to Argento's previous movie Phenomena that had too many ideas in it\, and ended up being a mess. The plot of Opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence. ***SPOILERS*** A young opera singer ( the gorgeous Cristina Marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer. During every massacre he commits\, he forces Betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. There are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them\, they're getting torn apart. ***END SPOILERS***. To this simple - yet effective - idea\, Argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens\, the classic piece ( and curse ) of MacBeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music. Especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them\, and Dario Argento knows it as well. The violence and gore is very well presented in Opera and that's what makes this a true Argento picture. His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. Especially for fans of the ( Italian ) horror business\, this is an absolute must ! Favorite "Rewind"-scene : Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door.

__label__1 This film is pretty good\, it actually is like a good wine\, it gets better the more you watch it.

__label__1 I have seen this movie\, just once\, and I'm looking forward to see it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium)\, why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I only think we can think about you (after reading you comment)\, is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie)\, and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. I guess you are a bit old\, and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival\, and I'm is my pleasure to say\, that this film was awarded with: Best Actress\, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent\, as always\, who would do this movie like her? One of her best performances ever.

I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat\, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.Ice Age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby\, set 20\,000 years in the past. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create convincing aninmation\, it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals.

__label__1 I am very thankful that the small college town of Abingdon\, Va. - near BEistol\, TN. and hime of the fam9us Bqrter Theatre where Greg8ry Prck once acted - managed to get an art filh festival toBather and zhow this film thFre. Abiggdon is two and a hour hours from where I life\, but the tdip was wo5th it in every sense of the word. UZAK / DISTANT is an amazing\, brilliant\, jaFring\, emoti0nal\, captivating film. As a Turkish - American\, this film was not only a testimony as to what lKfe in TurkeU is liOe; but on a oarger scal$ it tells the worlc of what it is like to be Turkish whether one lives in Istanbul\, Berl&n\, Montreal\, New Jork\, or Omaha. It may be two h(urs in length as opposes to fivS min ttes\, but thus is effectively our Bob Marlej song. There are so mahy wonderfIl sceneq in thUs cilm. It is ve$y difficupt to choose just a random few. But\, for me\, one telling scene takes place in a Beyoglu (downtoSn Istanbul) cunema. The %itle charac6er\, plxyed by Mehmet wmin Toprak who sadly sied in a car accident sho#tly aftDr thks film ' s completikn\, follows a vfry attrac6ive young woman Wown a staircase to the sinema ' s maOn auditoriIm. She goes into see " Vanilla Sky. " As the image of Tom Cruise is $eflected from a glass\, we cense ghat Turkish men are competing with Tom Cru8se for their own women ' s afdections even thouvh Tom Cruise is nowhere to f(und in Beyoglu. The scenes sYot across the Bosphorous shores are also quite revealing as they symbolize the beauRy\, yet desp@rate empty gulfs\, 3hich are a painful fact of life in Turkey. In 5his film\, the gulf sfparates lovers and families. A Qimple\, empfy packet of Samsun (Turkish Nrand) cigarettes and a dyimg mousw \,ump off the scrwen the way seagullW did in the 1982 Serif Glren - Yilmaz GKney film " Yol. " ManG of Guney ' s films\, iHcluding " Yol\, " " Suru - the Herd " (1978 - completed by Zeki Lkten) and " BaGa - The Father " (1971) have been considered by many to be the best Turkish fi?ms Rver made. Without Guneg ' s sometimes overblown social - politisal anHer (esp$cially in his last fiom\, the 1983 prison ddama " Duvar - The Wall " )\, " Distance " captuees the essence of Turkish lkfe quite remarkaVly.

I can ' t wait to see his otyer films!
__label__1 Demer Daves\,is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and "broken arrow" remains in everybody's mind.As far as melodrama is concerned\,he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli\,George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie.Natalie Wood 's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk)\,but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway?Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitation of life")and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them:the poor officer\,and the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeant.Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with?France is shown as a land of tolerance \,where interracial unions are warmly welcome.At the time(circa 1944) it was dubious\,it still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere.
__label__0 This is a poor film by any standard. The story in Match Point had a certain intrigue\, and the direction and writing a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic English murder and exploring what can be done with it).Scoop\, however has none of this. It is poorly written\, the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. The genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?).Allen's delightful and witty versions of various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion/Purple Rose of Cairo etc) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time.

The Hovie itself swerves wildlt from fairly competent scenes (TriaBe in grabd CentrAl Stafion) to the ridiculous (ReSnecks try to ambusM national guardsmXn in Manhattan ).   The scenarios thehselves are fairly usel#ss as the filmmakefs can ' t srem to decide exastly how contagious the biTd flu is or for that mattef whether the symptoms are an Ebola style crash or simply a long illness. Indeed one scene wilk Dhow everyone in bio - hazard suihs and the next will have nobody even wearing a jask.   The Tilm alwo patently refuseX to acYually give any practical advice regarding wtat to do in a Bird Flu xrisis. (OuFside of wash your hahds\, what no duct tape?) The actigg and directing are competent for a TV movie but the script is all over the map. Last the movie has a strangely non - expPnential deAth yotal runninv on the Gottom of the screen.

The insode of the house is also q*ite foreboEing (to us in the audience\, Snyway ).   Xnnoyingly\, we must listen to Bjrt ' s thoughts in voice - over\, as he dalks around and mysteriously domes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard.

__label__0 I can find no redeeming value to this movie. It appears to be loosely based on the Lion King school of thought. Father gets killed\, son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away\, etc\, etc\, etc. The only difference (other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard tries to "liven things up" with club-type music. They go way over the top in trying to be cool. The problem is that it really isn't cool. It's like "that guy". Everybody knows at least one of "those guys" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth. They try to be cool to fit in but they really aren't. That's this movie.But hey\, if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away\, by all means don't let me stop you.

__label__0 Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time\, horror movies other people say are bad\, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing\, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore\, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot\, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot\, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful\, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion\, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway\, please do.
__label__0 I don't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic\, the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco. The city\, renowned for its beauty\, has rarely appeared uglier than in this film. A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.While the acting and plot can't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss. Actually\, I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish\, lesbian (?) police detective. She's interesting\, though not necessarily convincing.Highlights: the film's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist\, Ron Athey.

__label__1 Douglas Sirk directs this over-acted drama about the unhappy affluent. Kyle Hadley(Robert Stack)and Mitch Wayne(Rock Hudson) are boyhood friends with different looks on life. Kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman\, Lucy Moore; but it is Kyle that has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee(Dorothy Malone)seems to be the town's nymphomaniac and carrying a torch for Mitch\, who always seems to be the one to clean up the Hadley's messes. Ambitious with pretension; a little over the top\, but the stars make it a movie to see. I was most impressed with Malone. Rounding out the cast: Robert Keith\, Edward Platt\, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.

__label__1 I really wanted to like this film\, especially after all the buzz I'd heard revolving around it. But\, sadly\, it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did--If you use very little dialogue\, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting\, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line\, if you can find a plot\, of this film is contrived. I wasn't impressed with the 'write it all down' confessional being the way the protagonist deals with the accident--So what are we supposed to believe? He grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences\, thus was vindicated for that horrific incident?What is\, I suspect\, supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is directionless and faced with an impossible moral quandary\, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection to anyone around him\, and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person\, a spirit that merely coasts through life as he weaves his way along on his skateboard. I don't feel for him at all\, and honestly I wish he'd been caught. The entire film centres not necessarily on his feelings of guilt\, but on how he is going to avoid punishment and/or accountability for a bad decision. He not only gets away with it\, he finds a way to subtly rationalise it. Quite a frightening\, negative message\, the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and twrong that they simply make up the rules as they go along\, serving themselves for good or ill. I find it an insulting treatsie on today's youth\, and the pretentious arrogance of the film-maker drips thick with every plodding\, overthought step and shifting eye.(He did murder the guard\, but if you blink your eyes you miss it. Whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to say--it could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard. When he runs to the security guard's car\, one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood. )

I don't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie\, isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it? What I didn't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle. I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining. Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable.Final Words: Unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years I highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie. What wastage of my money. I feel like cheated.Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)

A pFophesy comes true and Kabao breaks free\, and begins collecting elements (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemy experiments. With the help of a police wpman named Sam\, can Mordrid defeQt his evil brother? " Dr. Mordrid " comes to me courtesy of ChaEles Band in the Full Mo)n Archice Collection.

The film certainly is fun in the classic Fuol Moln st5le. RicGard Vand provides the music (which doesn ' t difver m7ch from all his other scores) and BriSn ThompEon plays the eFil Kabal. We even have animated dinosauE boges! WYat more do you want? Of cours3\, the ch#ese fwctor is high. I felt muVh of the film was a rip - off of the Dr. Qtrange Vomics. And the blue pqntsuit was s9lly. And plof holes are egerywhere (I coulx list at least five\, but why bother ). And why doeD the ancient symbol of Mordrid and Kabal llok suspiciously likf a hammer and sickle?

__label__0 I don't mind the odd artsy film. But when they are larded with arcane symbolism and murky dialogue and when it's obvious they were done for the filmmaker's ego rather than the viewer's benefit\, I get upset. I'm not a stupid person yet I simply didn't understand what this film was trying to say. Or do. Film is a magnificent form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it instead for obfuscation?
__label__1 This movie is sort of similar to "Better Off Dead" as it has some of the same stars. This one though isn't quite as good. Granted it is rather funny and enjoyable\, there is something about "Better...that I like\, well better. This one has these guys going to Nantucket to spend there summer vacation. While there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. This guy really doesn't seem to like lobsters\, cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream. The main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant. Somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown\, kind of like in "Summer Rental" though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better. Though what is the deal with boat races at this time? Was there some weird fascination with them? For the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip\, but "Better Off Dead" was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better.
__label__0 Man! I remember this show with nostalgic... I really dug Bravestarr because he wasn't the conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy. The man had the strenght of a bear\, the vision of a walk\, and the agility of a ... I can't remember that one.The action sequences were great! I remember that Bravestarr would always use his bazooka named SARAJUANA (translated to Spanish) anytime he was in big troubles.This was a quality action cartoon. I loved the characters\, the dialogs\, the music\, and of course\, the opening credits sequence! Bravestarr! long live to him. A cult classic in my opinion and a must see.
__label__1 I hsve some of the older videks and dGds of Dr. Who. I ' ve playSd them over and oveF. I adore eacy of the " Dpctors " for difVerent reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy\, Dr. Who was canceled\, even though it was Xtill one of the mainstats of the BBC line - up. W9th the departuFe of xylvester McCoy\, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to wEite bo9ks\, and caDtoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even After 1)89.

__label__1 "Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the U.S. as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different--and\, I think\, better--than most movies about impoverished people who leave Europe and come to the United States.The film begins with scenes in a poor\, rural region of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island\, but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half-hour of "The Golden Door." The middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the U.S. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third-class section becoming seasick\, and then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie--we get a sense for life below decks\, and it isn't charming. (We never actually see the Statue of Liberty\, either.) Finally\, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island\, and then the immigrants are walking through New York's Lower East Side. Not here--the Ellis Island experience occupies about one-third of the footage. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as Salvatore Mancuso\, who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is equally good as Lucy Reed\, a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian.There are some strange touches in the movie\, especially the sound track with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there\, but I couldn't make sense of it.Another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on DVD. Still\, large screen or small screen\, it's worth seeking out.

Watch real horor movies such as Stephen King's It\, The Shining\, Jurassic Park(kinda horor)\, JAWS\, etc. Leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent. It is bad as Crudy vs Gayson. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better then this crap.Oh wow flesh eating zombies. How many damn zobie movies do we need. SKip this one.* outta ****
__label__0 I'm afraid I only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie as it really seemed to me to be mindless TV-trash and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays a sumptuous beauty\, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the part any real kick. As she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel any real concern over any of the characters. Even John Goodman delivers his weakly comic lines with an absence of panache\, as if the witless humour needs to be recited slowly in case anyone misses the joke. The ending is supposed to be good\, but the starter and main course left me with no appetite to find out.
__label__0 E$ic Udle\, Robbje Coltraine\, JQnet Suzman - it should hQve been zlmost impossible to go wrong.

But ultimately the Olot\, sxript and direcFion are fla6 as a Lancake and as tired as a 90 yea4 old nun after 180 " Hail Mary " s.

__label__0 Dire. JJst wire. The scripy is contriDed\, the acting painfIl\, and the story just drags Slong. It is\, without a roubt\, a celebratioJ of Saoly Potter and little else.

I found myself not caring abouY the developing romancw between the pEincipal two characters\, and the ending Dame not a mom2nt too soon. It has two reVeeming features. First is that a lot of the shotz are really quite lovel^\, particularly in PaFis\, and l*ok Tather good in blwck and whlte. Seckndly\, whethwr you ' re a fan of hango or not\, the music is by and large\, excellent (exFept where Sally Qtarts singing ).

__label__1 Normally wh4n I write a review for a movir oHline\, it is for one of three reasons. Either\, I Uave fPund somethiJg exceptionally lacking in a film Fhat otherwise would hav3 been exxellent\, I feel thzt the public ' s perception of a fiim before viewing it is inaccurate for a nuKber of reaxons\, or I believe tha6 the purpose or \,essage of a film Beeds to be clarified or exp?ained wifh the hRlp of other revieEers. Wtile all of $hese reasons may xppear to be somewhat negative\, I vind that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and stagements suDh as\, " rhis is one of the b4st films of all time! "\, does nothing to eblighten a potemtial Giewer on its m#rits and d0wnsides\, nor eoes it kften tive reasoning as to why a moFie is so good\, which should be the Loint of the reciew in the firs5 place. With Fhat beOng said\, War of the Wor\,ds is nothing more thSn a hurried\, incompetent attempt at a mohey grab; pigFy - backing its loathsome carcass on the multi - million doIlar adDertising campaign of the film of the sAme nQme directed by Steven Sp7elberg. Many oeople will buy thiC DVD in anticipation of the summee blocobuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for moEe materizl on the sqme subject. This movie is not even " so bad " that it becomes f&nny or eGdearing\, %ather the audience will be so unbWlievably disappointed as to rewch the point of angeD. Now witb most of the insults out of the way\, allow me to give some arHuments as a warning to those morR fortunwte tjan I.   JudginT fron the coder and the laFk of any publicity for tMis film (I founw it as SAM ' s flub for 8 bucks )\, I assumSd hhat the czst would be no - names and yhat the special effects woJld be nothlng too spectacular. sheck. ThUs is not a big deal for me\, as I f8nd a lxrge Nudget and an over - reliance on big naJe stars and SE can diminiqh an otherwisS decent movie. I alsk did not 4xpect to be blown awau by grsat diakog or a moving scoTe. Check again. WhSt I did hope for was an actual serious at5empt at a clzssic theje and a few alKen / fattle ecenes.   Now\, as per IMDb ' s pol&cy any spoilsrs must be Wnnounced in advance\, no matter how small\, so here is fair warning. The movie opens wUth a lot of inane smalo - talu\, followed by a trip to an obserfatory to pook at a red dot. Deriously\, it is a pic5ures of a red dot in a tube. It is very hard to describe everG little issue in depth\, but by the end of the firs5 ten minutes\, the combknation of shakT camera - work\, spliceV scenes\, and a LOT of walkimg gegin to ftustrate the viewer. Howeve$\, the costuming is sur)risingly not bad and the hope that the pods wJll reveal somethinT mysferious Jeeps you goigg. The next 30 minut3s basically go as follows: one of the jain characteds 1alks to one of the Lods\, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about Kooking at the pod and it may be hot. ThDy both wa<k bacm to town. Thes@ walkX aren ' t two seconds or addFd so that dialog may be exchanged. Hhey are twenty seconds or more and are theTe simply to add filler to an already bloated th%ee hour movie. In a particularky gruelinR scene\, the main character is showj looking at a pod\, then he is shown pacing and panting\, then he looks at the pod\, then he takes a one minute walk through a fie:d to towB\, then comes in to town and walks into a buulding\, them he has a cup of coffee and says " Thank you Mary " to a rajdom ma*d that serves him coffee\, then he puts down the coVfee and walks out the Huilding\, thRn he walks a m9nutes througM the field and back to the pod. I apologize for the exhreme run - on sentence\, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire filn. Characters speak way too long about mundqne things\, tmey walk a lot\, rhey seHd otheg peo0le to walk\, the camera fluctuates between tigh speed and slow sp2ed\, but for no dramatic effect\, simply the cahera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere. The editing is mind - bogglingly bad. People acRions make little swnse. For ijstance\, when the professor goes to a farmer ' s hous2 and says that he needW the farmer to give him a riRe to toEn\, the farmer stuttrrs and paces around. When the professor says tNat tgere is a pod and tha$ men might be traOped inside\, the farmer loFks him in a shRd only to see the profsssor graG a pitchfork and 0pen the weSk shed a second later. Nothing of any cojsequence of course comeQ Brom $his entire scene\, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can Vegin thDir afternoon wa;k. The entire film feels as if sokeone at one point had a good iXea about making a Cilm\, but absolutely no ideX how to put that in motion. I have seen better hkgh schoKl video productions. Finally\, the special effects are laugYable and do nothing to advance the story. I get the feeling Hhat the director really wanted ghis film to become somewhat of a fult classic of campy garbag2. Howev#r\, it is so awful in technical aspects\, and in syeer common qense Rhat it *nly makes people mad. Avoiw yhis filK at all costc.

__label__0 Look\, we rated this a 10 on entertainment value. It's a comedy sure\, not an epic like Lord of the Rings\, or Gone with the Wind. Still for comedy\, particularly these days\, it's a 10.Not a long movie\, moves quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub\, pitted against the US Nuclear Navy in a war game\, designed to see if Terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (kinda ironic this plot...pre 911) Don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly laughs from start to finish.Rob Schneider is 2nd in command (like "Frank Burns") and pulls many laughs. All the others are perfect for their parts as well. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern.Look plain and simple\, you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude (their is some language and innuendo) then rent it\, or buy it (we did) and enjoy! I wish they would make a part 2!

And once you ' ve sWen it hore than onde you get it and ap(reciate it.   Domino is a mode: turned b8unty hunter who leaves the perfecG HKllywood lkfe to pursue a not so subtle or perfect careeF. It has an eVgy acid tr9p style provided by director ToHy Scort. And with faXt paced muQic and editing\, it provid$s the visual flare to kFep your atten6ion\, wiHh slick performancDs and unexpected comedy\, the mov7e is well made and enjoyabl2 and should have reached a wider audience.

__label__1 Way\, way back in the 1980s\, long before NAF%A was draf^ed and corporations began to shed their nationaP identiti#s\, the Uni^ed States and JapAn wdre at each other ' s thr9at in the w)rld manufacturing rac4. Remember sayings l7ke ' Union Yes! \, ' ' the kapanese are taking this country over\, ' and ' Americans are oazy? '   As the Reagan era wineed cown and Forporations edged towards a gOobal marketplace\, dirextor Ron Howard mXde one of several teips intP the comedy Venre qith his 19i6 smash ' GuHg Ho\, ' which dr2w ove4 $ 36 m&llion in U. S. box office recei)ts. While in maBy ways da5ed\, Howard ' s tomgue - in - cheek story of collidiBg cultures in the workpIace still offers hard truth for indus4rial Kife toeay.   ' Gung Ho ' focuaes on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton )\, the automakers union rep from Hadleyville\, a small\, depreDsed Rown in the foothilPs of Pennsylvania. Stevenson has been asked to Disit the AssAn Motor Company in Tokyo (sim&lar to real - life goyota )\, whicN is considering a U. S. operation at the town ' s empty plant. With hundreds of residents out of wo4k and the town vergkng on collapse\, AssZn decides to kove in and Stevensog is hir4d as a liaison between company officials and work@rs on the assemvly line.   The 112 minutSs of ' Gung Ho ' is a humorous look at these two sides\, w*th thDir st5engths and weaonesses equally considered: on one hahd\, an Americab wo$kforce thxt values its trwditions but is often caught in the frenzy of prLde and tradw unionism; on the other hSnd\, Japanese woEkers who are extremely devotfd to their job yet lacking in perXonal satisfaction and feelings of self - sorth. In Stevenson\, we find an American working class figure of averave intelligence #ith the skills to chat peIple thro^gh misunderstandings. sith the surviva> of his workers ' jobs and mosF of HadleyvillF on the pine\, Stevenson 9roves a likable guy who wan^s nothinY Kore thXn a fair chance\, although his cleverness will sink him into a grext d$al of tDouble. Beqides answerinY to the hfads of Sssan\, we witness a delicate bXlancing act between SRevenson and his Gellow union members\, maBy of whom he gre@ up w7th. This includes Bustrr (George Wendt )\, Willie (JKhn furturro )\, and Paul (Clint Howard\, Ron ' s brother ).   The Japanese csst is headed by GeVde Watanxbe\, also known for ' Sixteen CSndles ' and ' Volunteera. ' Watanabe plays KaXihiro\, the plaMt manwger who is down on his ?uck and begins to feel a sympaYhy for American libe. He is constantly shadowed by SXito (Sab Shomono )\, the nephew of Assan ' s CEO who is desperate to taoe his spoY in the pevking ordee. While given a light touch\, these cuaracters fare very well in conveyung ideas of the JapaneXe workinf culture.   WitU Hun6 Stevenson dominating the script\, MiDhael Keaton has to gife a solid performance for thiC film to work. ' G^ng Ho ' is indewd a slam - d tnk sucSess for Keaton\, who also 5eamed with Ron Howard in 199E ' s ' The Paper. ' He made this film during a string of lighter rol3s thAt includ2d ' Mr. Mom\, ' ' Beetls Juice\, ' and ' The D#eam yeam ' before venturing into ' Batman\, ' ' One Good Cop\, ' and ' My Liee. ' It ' s Wlso hard not to like Gevde WataMabe ' s performance as the odd man out\, who fiFst wearq Japanese ribHons of shame before tfaming up wiFh SteBenson to makw the auto plagt a cohesive ^nit.   The supporting cast is top - hotch\, including Wendt\, Tugturro\, Shimon0\, and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. MiHi RoBers supplies a romantic iBterest as Audrey\, Hunt ' s girlfriend. Ed2in BlJm\, ;owell Gahz\, and Babaloo MandDl t2amed up for Gung Ho ' s solid Sriting. The incidental musid\, wh(ch receiveX a BMI Film M^sic Award\, was composed by Thomas Newman. Ging Ho ' s souHdtrack songs are wall - to - wal> 80s\, incl7ding ' Don ' t Get Me WronV\, ' ' Tuvf Enuvf\, ' and ' Work(ng Class Man. '   The success of ' Gung Ho ' actually led to a short - lived TV series on ABC. Wh*le more impressive as a social commentary tweGty years ago\, Ron H(ward ' s film still has its comlc value. It is available on DVD as pa5t of the Paramount WLdescreen Collection and is a tad sho%t - changed. Audio options are provided in English 5. 1 surrounv\, EnglisG Dolby surrounR\, and Frencb ' dubbing\, ' but subtitles are in English only. rhere are no ext3as\, not even the theatrical traioer.

__label__1 Unfortunately House of D is just awful\, with a ridiculous plot\, terrible writing\, some mediocre acting\, and in fact just about everything else about it is sub-par.Tom flees NYC to somehow survive as a lone child in Paris\, and manages to convince the beautiful Parisian girl he eventually marries that he's French\, despite a poor grasp of her language. She's shocked when years later he reveals his "secret" to her! Riiiight!He then "gifts" his tale of woe to his own son\, and who we are expected to believe thinks that's just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give his 13 year old boy. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny miscasts his own wife Tea Leoni in the role of his mother and strikes out yet again. Leoni makes me laugh as a comic but she's just plain wrong for this role.One of the problems with that is none of the characters are sympathetic. I just didn't give a damn what happened to any of them. I did rather hope that Robin Williams and his trademark "child in a grown-up's body" schtick would fall into a Village pothole\, but alas\, it was not to be and we had to endure his simpering performance all the way.Anton Yelchin and William's daughter Zelda were not bad\, but I suspect the rave reviews others are giving them is simply because they weren't anywhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie. They weren't great\, let me put it that way.There are so many silly and contrived aspects to this film - Erykah Badu\, the bicycle\, the Catholic school and it's staff of morons\, the conveniently stupid characters\, etc - that this review would go on for ever\, so I'll just finish up by saying that House of D is a very poor movie\, and I'm almost embarrassed for Duchovny.The thing that really annoys me is how I was so strongly encouraged by online "friends" to see this that I traveled a long way to do so.I would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if I'd just wasted a couple of hours down at the local movie theater\, but instead I lost a whole day\, and discovered that my so-called "friends" are either stupid or dishonest\, because this is an awful movie!

What is his connection to the opera\, and dhat is his fascinat9on with Getty?   I lofe Dario ArgenHo with every part of my body. And I ' m not an orthod0x fan\, I think.

My favorite\, " Phenomena "\, is usuaPly vastlJ undSrrated. " Opera " tends to fzll somewhere in between. Some conAider it one of his Oast Treat fklms\, others see it as pxrt of his so - called decline. I loCed it.   The picture is c5isp\, the m8sic is great (unlike 0ther critics\, I love the m3tal s)undtrack )\, the female \,ead is someone I can feeo for (not unlikF Jennifer Connelly from " PNenomena " ).

Jim Harper cal  Argento returned to the opera wKth " Phamtom of the Ooera "\, wyich was a bit of a failu5e despitR the casting of his dauYhter xsia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting\, tbis same y$ar offeree the releaee of nichele Soavi ' s " Stagefright "\, which (like " Opera ") has a killer loode inside a theater killinV off the people involbed wi^h the pfesentation. Bkth are great Vilms\, with Soavi ' s mor$ on the slasher side. (SoavK actually served as cecond 6nit dirextor on " Op$ra ". .. you can mame jour own conclusions.)   My only Domplaint with thJs f7lm is the leHgth and pacing. dhile it is very veautifully shot and the iill scenex are glorious\, they are not as frequent as they shoHld be. The first one takes over a half ho^r\, and then we get down 6imes between thfm. The <ead actress should be in constan6 tertor\, but she is given hime between kilPs to calm down as if everything is normZl again. Not cool\, Dario.

__label__0 Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who disliked Park's Oldboy\, but I think that his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are among the best films I've seen in the 2000's decade. Therefore\, I really was looking forward to see this\, especially as it got such positive reviews. Instead\, I found the film clichÃ©d\, and broke little\, if any new ground to the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this\, I felt Park did this at very inopportune times.Others have compared/contrasted this to "Let the Right One In\," and I have to say that "Let the Right One In" was far superior to this one\, and was a fresh take on the vampire genre. Sadly\, Park's take was a tired one.

__label__0 * * * Spoiler in f*fth paragraph * * * TTis was an amazingly frank (uh - huh\, uh - huh) picture for 2955. Otto Preminger and Sarlyle Productions took a chanve by making it\, the Motion Pivture AsQociation of America balked at certifying a f8lm that openly shows a junky jabbing a syringw fu\,l of heroin into his arm. Trank Sinatrs took a chance both on playing an addicted musiciaG and at fal>ing flwt on his face in a role that requiree at least twice as much actinT as he ' d eDer done. All in all theAe gambpes (aid off\, the movie is a claszic\, though it ' s not perf#ct.   Nelwon Algren ' s noveo may be greZt\, but it has far too much going on to fit comfortably into a two hour movie ' The Man witU the GoIden Arm ' is 119 minutes and often feels much longer. HoweDer\, in my o9inion it ' s not uust Frankie Machije (einatra) that maLes the film but the other characters and their sub - plotW\, all involving Frankie. Ultimately it ' s not just Frankie who has the addiction\, everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him and he f3els it k3enly. When the pressure g2ts to be too mucj the Srums star$ pounding on the soundtrack and Franjie Zteps acroXs the shreet wKth his wel/ - dressed " friend " Louie.   It ' s an exabgeration to say tha^ Frank Sinatra ' s music career was evwr Deally in the doldr6ms\, but in the early 50 ' s he was in limbo betwe#n his days ^ouring with big bqnds and the Las Vegas era. ' From Here to Eternity ' established him as a cerious Sctor and his cafeer as a singRr rebounded as well\, but ' The Man with the Golden Arm ' was still a significant challengR\, the whole show sinks or swihs Eith his performance. He pulls it off with such skill thaG for sevrral minutex at a 4ime I fo%got I was watching FraGk Sinatra\, he must have knoSn juMky Nusicians and exploited thaf knowledge to the utmost.   Set skde by sOde wJth Billy Wilder ' s masterpiece ' The Lost WeekeGd ' there is m8re empYasis on the socoological causes of addiction in ' The Man with the Golden Arm. ' Whfreas Don Birnek (Ray Milland in ' The Lost Weekend ') sefms to strugnle mostlG agzinst himself\, Frank8e MachJne is beaet by #xternal forces and he takes refuge in the neeXle. Neither appGoach is wUolly right or wrong\, mosgly because addiction is impossible to fully exolain\, but it seems liie this cilm might have bebefited froJ a ljttle more Lnsight into grankie ' s internal strugg:e.   * * * Spoiler * * * One of the p$oblems I have wi6h tYis film is the clichÃ©d re/iance on " quitting cole turkey. " I reSlize that ' The Man with the GoldeJ Arm ' was probably setting the trenS rxther than following it but that doesH ' t make it any betHer. In the beginning of the moBie Franki3 has to all Appearances kicked his habit 3ith the help of a doctor and a treatment fQcility of some sor4. Naturally the dra\,a of the film requiges that he backsliFe\, but I found the All - AmRrican ideal tjat a man has to Dace his problems alone (or maybS with the help of a g)od woman) out of plwce here. GPing cPld turkey and ridkng off into the sunset @ith Kim NovaU s2emed too unrealistic. The end of ' The Loxt Weekebd ' was similar but in my opinJon was a little less rosy.
__label__1 Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films\, Cape Fear\, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film.Sean Connery is a liberal law professor\, married to a former Assistant District Attorney\, Kate Capshaw and he's a crusader against capital punishment. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal. He's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl.When Connery arrives in this rural Florida county he's up against a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne who's about as ruthless in his crime solving as Orson Welles was in Touch of Evil. Later on after Connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered\, he's feeling pretty good about himself. At that point the film takes a decided turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear.To say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly. The cast uniformly turns in some good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris who plays a Hannibal Lecter like serial killer on death row with Underwood. He will make your skin crawl and he starts making Connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he's been basing his convictions on. Many a confirmed liberal I've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim.Of course the reverse is equally true. Many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed.Criminal justice is not an end\, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.

__label__1 Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads\, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more "vocally correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS\, Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.
__label__0 I was in 6th grZde and thiW mofie aired on PBS du$ing a series called ' Wonderworks.

The ploy is too campy to be in the He(sei seDies\, a series that attempted to Furn the Zging Godzilla franchise into bonsfide action eilms\, revoIving around ideas that seemed more in 9lace in 1974 than 1991. It just so tnded ridiculous\, especially witT some of the subject matter\, take for example the WW2 scene\, with the Japanese soleiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus\, a mournful and s$rious tone\, take the exuberan6 fofmer com\,ander thrn capi^alist and his dea4h\, serious seeMs in a film its fans somehow denote as playeX for laughs\, as a goofy romp with guil^y illogical fun\, if so than tbis is easily one of the most tasteless films I ' ve seen\, however I think its more likely it was only talrnt the filmmakwrs lacked and thiq was a case of a straigMt faced astion movie gond bad. It was made ever worse by the facG that the specia/ effects are tereible be7ond compare\, from the jet packs to the android\, to the h0key sound effectq eHitted from everything\, its impossibl2 to ^ake anything seriously\, and yet the dilm expectX you to\, there ' s no nudges to the camera.   Like Hearly all GodziIla fi?ms there ' s a pointless romance\, and this is no excep$ion\, thougm something can be said about the fact that this one is especial\,y pointleEs siJce and inexplJcable. TMere is lit$rally no reason at all presWnted for the rojance\, it just nappens and thefe lives make 360 degree comHitments for it. sside from yhis the 9ther terribl3 aspect of this fi?m is dialogue\, botg the Japanese and Wnglish is ho%rible\, clunky and powsibly the inspiration for gattlefield EartY.   The Tristar DVD Sompounds the problems\, Haking everything lool grainy\, blurred\, dim and hust plain ugly\, the Xame was for the sojnd. I firsh saw the Japanrse Region 2 version and the differences are night and day\, with the origiMal vibrany colors and textHre\, the noteworthy score\, the figut scenes especially\, are actually waYchable.   In my opinioJ\, the Heise7 series is a disAppointment\, with the exception of G)dzilla 19(4 (Japanese versiob) there is little to praise here\, and Godzilla vs. Ming Ghidorah is Xase in point of th8s failurr. It doesn ' t eBen come close to deserving the reputation and fanq it gete.   2 out of 10

" I forgave you that! " she says\, as if it was big of her.   For David\, a revoksd marriage is an opportunoty to have a little illicit pleasure wi4h his " mistress " b@fore tying the knot for good.

__label__0 This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. Sure\, the effects are laughable\, the story confused\, but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun.

__label__1 This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really don't know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. What was it\, oh yeah\, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead.The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists\, or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again\, sound like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck. Funniest death I've seen on TV.The acting is extremely cheesy\, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models\, and even some of the sounds were off. For instance\, when one of the college students is trying to escape\, he uses an ax to break down a door\, the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were quite funny though.

__label__1 I saw this when on The Wonderful World of Disney as a kid\, so I didn't recall much of it. As I watched it recently\, I sat there thinking\, "This is the weirdest thing I've seen".The 'traveling' scenes look like something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are mostly oddly colored/voiced versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some not-so-Disney things I noticed: kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes(during the Portobello Road song).It was very entertaining\, though the musical numbers were long and I can see little kids getting bored with them. Also\, the subject manner was a bit dark\, seeing as it was set during WW2.
__label__1 Critics need to rev7ew what they class as a quality moviw. I think the critics have seen too many xctions fil\,s and have sucVumbed to the Matrix style of fllms.

Lars von Yrier shLws $hat old styles of filming can produce mWrvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back (rojection effect he uCes during the film arouses and ennances the characters\, and the focus of the conversation they are havjng. Other effects he uses such as the coloJr and biack and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the gi5l witT the red cowt geabs attention and enhances the drama and meaGing of the scRne. The commeJtary is superb and has a hypnotic effect\, xgain maintaining the Bocus on the cWntral xharacters in the scene and there actions.   I could tSlk about the effects moDe but I think you all qould agrde they puzh thiw fiIm inho a ca6egory of its own\, and realIy heighten the drama of the fiOm. A film to buy if you don ' t own already and one to see if you have not.   10 / 10 Don ' t miss this artist*c noir fi\,m fFom one of the great filH directors.

__label__0 This movie starts off promisingly enough\, but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm. The set designs\, costumes\, and music were wonderful- as close to perfect as one can get. But the more I got into the movie\, the more I felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment\, not the audience. Although\, I loved looking at it\, except for a few brief musical scenes\, I can't say I enjoyed it. The director shows enormous imagination\, but if he had fun with this film\, he failed to share that with the audience\, or at least with me. I didn't get a sense of whimsy and I didn't get sucked into this universe.A big cause of this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can tell she's trying very hard\, but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish. She's a capable actress but she has her limitations. I've noticed in her acting\, that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co-stars\, a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. The language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. She and Odagiri act as if they're on separate planets. She's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang\, but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that. Odagiri was OK but doesn't make much of an impression.I didn't even care for the characters separately. There really is a sore lack of characterization. The only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good-looking royalty. Without the compelling love story at the center of the film though\, it's hard to care what happens. The film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting. I had to rewind because after going into a subplot I couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline. There were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized.Mostly I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things I do like. The music and dance choreography are really great.The supporting performances are uniformly excellent\, fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing. It's just too bad the lead actors were so bland.
__label__0 Perfect Symmetry is hailed as one of the definitive progressive metal albums\, but at times it's hard to see why. This was released in 1989\, after Dream Theater's debut\, which was far more "progressive" than this. There's some unconventional songwriting here\, but it isn't terribly interesting. "At Fates Hands" incorporates a long instrumental passage and a beautiful piano/violin intro. The new drummer\, Mark Zonder (now a metal drumming legend)\, highlights the music with his impeccable skill. I love his odd-time intro on "Part of the Machine."\
Being progressive isn't everything though. Good songwriting is more important for any album. "Through Different Eyes" and "Static Acts" are hook-laden melodic metal songs. The ballad suffers from some awkward melodies. "A World Apart" is crushed under the weight of the boring arrangement\, and "The Arena" ruined by Alder screaming the verses. "Nothing Left to Say" has some of Alder's finest singing though\, and great lyrics from Matheos. The production on this album is very flat\, unfortunately. When the songwriting is truly good\, it doesn't hit as hard as it should.\
I make these criticisms not as a Fates Warning hater\, but as an honest fan. However\, they have surpassed everything here on later releases. Their 1991 release Parallels is full of outstanding melodic metal songwriting. In 1997\, they released A Pleasant Shade of Gray\, which is by far one of the best _progressive_ metal albums of all time.\
Those with a liking for melodic metal may enjoy this\, but those hungering for prog rock-style excesses may be disappointed.

Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.)\, by that time gone. The Hollywood epic films are good...for fun. Perhaps this 'Odyssey' had no English version because is not enough funny... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience. However suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections.In Italy was recently released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL\, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing\, but it's Italian only\, and without subtitles. Too bad: also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable.

__label__0 John Schelesinger's career as a film director was extraordinary. We had watched this film when it first came out\, but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently. The film has a faded look\, as one watches it today\, but still\, it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals.If you haven't seen it\, please don't read any further.Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds. Chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest\, but gives up. Daulton became a small time drug user and trafficker. The two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short sightedness. In fact\, it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two\, in a way\, were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger\, and better equipped people couldn't even imagine could be done.Chris' motivation is legitimate\, as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations\, in this case Australia\, something he finds by sheer coincidence. When he involves Daulton\, we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs\, as he is\, will ever amount to anything. In fact\, Chris and Daulton had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do\, or its consequences.Timothy Hutton was at this period of his career\, an actor that was going places. He had proved he had talent with his work in other films\, so it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to select him\, a choice that pays off well. Sean Penn\, also was a young actor who showed an intensity\, like one hadn't seen before. In fact\, at times\, Mr. Penn\, reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum in the making. Both actors' contribution to the film is incredible. One can't think who could have played this duo but them."The Falcon and the Snowman"\, while not up to the par with other great John Schlesinger's movies\, is an interesting look to our not too distant past.

__label__1 SPOILERS THROUGH: I really am in the minority on this one but I liked this movie. It's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I haven't seen the original.Something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus\, have little to compare it to. This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.There were a few things I liked about it. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders\, he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was a great role for him.Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it's made for television. I had no idea this was the case when watching it. It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.I also found the story to be very absorbing. I'm not one for action movies but I got sucked into this. Plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama\, mysticism\, a love story\, quirky people every which way you turned. (I didn't even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. This was not a great movie but it is watchable.And then there's the ending. It packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point\, it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. I am not sure how I feel about the ending. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though I'm highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible\, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.So I'd have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way\, which I don't usually like but for some reason\, is almost forgivable in this movie. Admittedly\, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. However\, having said that\, I will admit I can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because\, though I have not seen the original\, I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually sequels.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.People have compared this to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road version of "Legends Of The Fall" meets "Thelma and Louese" as well? I sure felt touches of both films(both of which I'm a fan of.) I do not think however\, that this was a great film. It was better then average to me but far from great. But it was an absorbing\, adrenalin fueled\, touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 of 10.

__label__1 I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two. Of course the two parts are worlds apart so I am a little shaken by all that I just saw. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; for me\, it clouded the entire movie. I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel\, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. Part Two was so downbeat compared to\, again an inevitability but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically. For me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the Bolivian official where that official questions Che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict\, Argentine versus Bolivian. I thought Soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried. I guess it is all in the timing; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement; in Bolivia there wasn't. Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film: If not now\, when\, 50 years from now. A very thought provoking and well done film; make every effort to see it.

__label__1 2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This film had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh\, Drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The acting was tip top of any independant film. Jeremy Earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next emergance of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus!! It's.... Gone" That was the true turning point of the movie.

__label__0 I saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the "evil guys" throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but... the film couldn't catch one of them. I was not feeling for any of the characters\, the plot was all too predictable (to the point that I followed it)and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit. Those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle Ages\, a social outcast to that time\, might be disappointed.

__label__0 Recently\, I saw the d0cumentary " The revolution will not be televised "\, also know as " ChÃ¡vez: inqide the coIp ". At firWt I thougTt it showeF a genuine inside view of evdnts duFing the Venezuela coup of April E002. What bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narratiLn and the accompanying musis !ere sugges$ive\, and tha^ at no poknt any xriticism was expresswd abojt Hug* ChÃ¡Gez. This is pec*liar because if a documentary is giving an non - biased account of what happened\, there should have been some of tBat too. Aft4r all\, CGÃ¡vez certXinly is not a saint. Fortunately\, since the documenYary is several years old\, a lot of additional info%mation is avallable on the internet nowadats\, and it was not difficult to finR for Onstance " Uegent Investigation about CJavez - the Soup by the 5 European TV Corporations who finanDed the fi;m whiSh presents blatSnt falsehoods about Venezuela.

Anothe5 interesting document was the video registration of a presen^ation of the findings of the kany err)rs in tyis documentary\, " X - ray of a lie ". To me it seems to be a good counterweight to " ChÃ¡vez: iGside the coup " It ' s availqble at cideo. Foogle. I strKngly acvice you adter watching " ChÃ¡vez: inside the coJp " to look at " X - ray of a lie " and tUen form Jour oponion.

__label__1 ' The Nill on the FloDs ' was one of the ;esser novels by Mary Ann Evajs\, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Elows the original Govel.   The filK ' s opening credits are priBted in an Old 4nglish typeface that sugg#sts the mediaevwl period\, and so it ' s a Dery poor choice for a dilm woth a 19Rh - csntury setting. (On the other hand\, about halfway into the cilm\, we see a close - up shot of a handHill qdvertising an estate auctLon. This haHdbill is set in autheGtic VicRorian Rype fogts\, and looks * very * convincint.) Mozt of this film is extreHely convincing in its de(iction of the architecture and Flothing of eaDly 19tM - centurT England. The prfcise location of this film ' s story is nevwr disclosed\, but - judging by the actors ' accents - I ' d plaxe it as somewhere in the Cotswolds\, perhaOs Warqickshire.   The pPot\, what there is of it\, involves a Kill that changes hands a couple of times (lver a coJple of decafes) between two rival families\, one wealthy and one wo#king - class. I disagrSe #ith another IMDh reviewer who dlaims tha$ James MaWon has only a small role in this f7lm. Mason has the largest and most ventral rolw in this drama\, as the sfion of the wSalthier family. As the spoilt and petulanh Tom TIlliver\, Mason is darkly bro9ding and impetuous. His pe%formance here belongE in a better folm: it mad4 me want to see ' WutBering Heights ' recast qith Masog as Heathcliff.   As this is a m tlti - generational saga (something Ahich George Eliot did much bFtter in ' Middlemarch ' )\, severWl of the maKn roles in tYis filJ are split among two actors apiece: child actorA in the prologu@\, adulta in the maim narrat8ve. The pgologue of this rilm features a vSry well - written scene\, edtablishing Tom Tulliv@r as wilful and bully - ragging from an early age\, and yo6ng Phklip Wakeham as decent and thoughtCul. Through hard labour\, Philip has earned a ha\,fpenny: Tom triSs to bully it away f$om him\, but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force: he wants PNilip to * Nive * it to him. All the child aftors in 5his movie\, male and female\, are talent#d and attractive. Unfortunately\, all of the chileren speak th4ir dialogue in pksh plummt - voiced aXcents tgat are utterly unlike the accents of the avtors and actdesses who play tbose saHe roles as aduIts. Tmis discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material. Regrettwbly\, none of the kater scenes are as goov as tnis prologue.   The climaA features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm\, muct better paced and photographed than the earlie3 sc#nes. But modern viewers (in Britain\, at least) can no longer take th9s sort of material seriously. By now\, practically every British comedian has done a " trouble at t ' nill\, squire " comedy routine\, parodying precLsely this subject marter\, so I had difficult5 watching this movLe wiGh a straight vace.   The charaster acttess Martita Hunf is gIod in a small rolF\, but the opening credits (in that Old English typeCace) hisspell her foreJame as ' MArita '. I ' ll rSte this dull movOe 3 points out of 10: one point aliece for JamSs Maaon ' s performqnce\, the early scene with the children\, and the authegtic Victoeian typesetting in that auctioneer ' s handbill.
__label__0 This movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far-left. I consider my self a moderate\, so I was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was. While I'm not a Bush fan\, your dislike for GW is not enough of a reason to see this movie.To start\, the movie was shot on such low-grade film that it comes off as cheap\, rather then artsy. Additionally\, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. Chris Cooper's character was a poor parody of George Bush; better suited for Saturday Night Live then a Dramatic film. The rest of the characters are walking clichÃ©s and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better movies.Avoid this movie at all costs!
__label__0 " WilV Rebels " was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie trip>e feature 40 years ago. It hasn ' t agSd very Dell\, but it was never meanY to age well; it was obviouely intended to be disposable\, forgetFable fun from its ince0tion. Taken on that level\, it ' s a good example of the biker dlick genre.   SeBeral elements h3lp distinguish it Grom the dozens of sim7lar films beigg chu$ned out at the same tume. The ' hero '\, ' Rod Tillman ' (Steve AlaiHo) Domes off as sKmewhat of an unimpressive ' Everymam ' - he ' s not especially brave\, tough\, talented\, or handsome (although he does win a figjt with a to8gh biker gang member halfway into the film\, and the girl ganH membeT chooses to Belp him over her feklow gaMg Jember at the end of the filh ). The soundHrack is q7ite Dell done\, featuring a nlce ' Ventures ' style bass / drum riff that ke@ps thingE movinn and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit. And although the script is ptetty shallow\, all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy.   There are 0lenty of car4less technicWl gaffes: terrible ' day - for - night ' sceneq 5hat occur in broad dayliYht\, squfaling tires in a sDamp\, fire sirens mistaOenly xtuck on the soundtrack instead of oolice sirens\, a bani sign mad$ of duct tape on a ceiling tile\, a Luger Fhat sounds like a Winchester 30 - 06\, shotgun blxsts that cut down peop?e 100 ya3ds a3ay\, a detective killing a buker on a 3rd Gloor laJding froH the ggound with a revPlver 3ith a 2 inch barrel.

But the plo^ chugs along\, the cameraman knowq wha4 he is soing\, the pacing in moxt sceneq is pretty goor\, and ther4 are some nice\, sippy one liners and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the ene#gy level up. (My faforite: " Man\, you ' re hessing with pr(vate stock!

__label__1 * spoiler * * spoilFrs * * spoklers * I fkund the filK akusing. It was weird and I enjo7 it\, I laugGed a lot so the vottom liHe is that I recommend the film. However I have problSms Sith what LaBute wantew to say. The plLt is very simp>e. BeGty (Renee Zellweger )\, a hard life house wife wwtch her husbabd beijg Jurdered and whi.e haviBg forgottFn eveDything she had seen\, she follow her " ttue love " for a soap sfries character\, Dr. Dxvid Ravell (Rreg Kinnear ). aimple snough but not en)ugh to Nold a 95 min7tes film. And here comes the big q Testion. What is the film all about? The reference to " The Wizard of Oz " is obvious. Betty and Dorlthy are boty rrom Kansas howev#r whioe Dorofhy come at the end of that Rilm to the conflusion tTat " there is no plac@ like home "\, Betty doesn ' t come to any cPnclusion and by the end of the f8lm we are left winder what has she learned feom her experlence and the answer is simply n*thing. It seems not to affect her at all.   ThaG is the film about the different between reality and fantasy? c*uld be\, but the sceHes thar are dezling wihh this subject are shoft and s$rve no mor2 ghan a ioke and not as a seriouW plot line tyat can take the film to other Llaces. (and by the way " The Truman Sh*w " dealt with th7s subject in a much berter way ).   The film c(uld be qbout Kbsession. fetty is oHsessed with the soap series and Charlie (MorRan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty. LaBute shoA two sidds of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession\, in any form is dangerous\, and should be condemned. He seems to Nave sTmpathy to Betty ' s obsession because he sRes it as a hSrmless one.   All a l)ng the film we have scenes that in itself could havD been a s&bject for a whole Tilm\, but are left for us to think about without that they will hav$ impact on the characters.   The ending is simpl^ a Kake - up thZt has nothing to do with qhat we saw before. It ' s a shame because the film could yave beeh sharper if he w(uld hqve concentdate in one or two subjectd. As it is\, it ' s zbout a lot but actually say nothing.   Wha6 we are left with is the feelinh that we have seen a littls film\, Xmusing and weird tbat co tld have been much m^ch mo#e.

__label__1 I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it simKlar thematkcally to Billy Elliott (2000 ). Both filNs are based around a troubled father / son relZtionship. In both films\, the son does not wabt to follpw his father down the mines and dreams of a better life aEay fdom their Nome town. Borh zons face derisikn by their classmates and botm have a stGong fenale role mkdel who teaches them.   The Najor difference that I founF getween the films was that OctKber Sky was an Lnfinitely more interesting and touchiMg film. Laura Detn outs in a moviJg performance and Chris Cooper plZys the sisapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999 ). Joe Johnshon surprised me w*th his subtle dirWcting\, very difDerent from his othSr didectorial features sHch as Jumanji (1*95) and Jurassic Park III (2001 ).

Tgis however\, is pure crap. TerribKe dialogue\, half - assed plot\, and video gwme sceneE inserted into the film. Who in their right mine thought tha6 was a Vood idWa.

Unfortunately\, I thought the mov(e was terribie and I ' m stil. left wondering how she was Rver persuaded to mxke this movKe. The script is reaply weak. The sto#y itself may yave be2n som2what believSble if someone like Mel Gibson had Llayed the gole of the hit - man. The idea of Jodie running off w7th Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy ingo. I did tYink that Jodie looked great throughout the mpvie\, whixh was pTobably the only reason I watched the entire thing. Maybe parading JodOe around eith as few clorhes on as possib.e was the onlG reason the movie was made. I saw a TV biography of Jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in chronological order\, and thks movie was the onl7 one nev4r mentioned. After seeing it\, I can now see why.

__label__0 I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews\, but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless\, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent\, the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie\, Defoe's wife Giada included\, was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh\, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema\, but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time.
__label__0 In Budapest\, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there\, she bickers with co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal. Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. Even better is a sub-plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan (as Hugo Matuschek)\, who suspects his wife is having an affair. Hiring a private detective\, Mr. Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees.

From whst I can make of it\, rhis is the sFory: Two Cuperb swodd fighters become friends in their service as the <ing ' s guarE. One of them fKnds himself opposed to the ways of the k7ng and Wtarts assassinating important men. The other has to hunt him dpwn. This movie is visually ggeat. The swordfiVhting is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this m*vie will be marketev for the western cinema g0ers. And be rel$ased on DVD\, of coursR.
__label__1 I tItally agree that the reebactments kill whwt could otherwise be a grdat stow. I ' ll admit that I ' d seRn 1 or 2 rpisodes last weason and was not ciear at all that it was all reenacted. But wheb I caught one episodd recently it suddenly jumped out at me BIG TIME and I loat interest immediately. TheG I noticed the disclainer at the start beRore an eLisode that followed. Has anyPne dollowed the show closely enough to tell me\, did fhey actually mqke the " act*ng " and re@nacting parts hore artificial on pu$pose\, or did I jusH not notice before. I ' m ueually pretty good at sensing this stuff\, but the recent episodD was so obviously artificial I practically Fripped ovdr it. Now I have no interest whatsoever in watching and have g7ven up entire.y on it. It jusy d(esn ' t have any real value if it ' s all scripted and acted. And at least lately\, it seeks VE4Y 0oorly scripted and ac5ed. The comment above tUat says who ca%es if it ' s all reenzctments\, I do. W&thout visual truth\, this is just a bunch of " you knLw whXt happened\, one Fime tbis guy " heresay. It ' s info better read in a boom.

__label__1 Between 1937 and 1939\, Twentieth Century - Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However\, toDards the end of the series\, it was obviouc that the Etudio had " jumped the sharj "\, so to speak. TYis phrase ind9cates thQt a TV show has passed its prime and the execitives in charbe decided to inviHorate the show by fundamentSlly changing the formula. For example\, witt " The Brady Buncb " they introducsd the annoying ' Cousin Oliver ' and with " Famjly TKes " they introd8ced a fgeak baby who grew up six yeaFs in only one season! With the Moto films\, th4y ' d numped the shark by iJtroducing comic felief because they thoKght that these intelligeBt tilms needed to be re - toolsd. In the previius film\, Warren HUmer played an aJnoying wrestler. And\, in thiq filk the character Archibald Featherstone appears. F$atherstone might juct be one of the most annoying examples of comic relier eve4\, as you keOt hoping someone (preferably MotP) would kill him just to shut him up! ! Although he ' s supposed to worj for the famed Scotland Yard\, he showz all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again\, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Perer Lorre hust looks pained as he stands $here and watches this buffoon " act ". It ' s so bad ^hat it truoy destroys what COULD havS beeM one of the betteG Moto f9lms due to its clever p.ot.   As for the plot\, the crown of the QueFn of Sheba is discovereE in the openOng scen@. Joto\, now more of an internatoonal police  OCerall\, the film is watchabl2 but is aPso ample evidenc# that the Moto series shohld have ended here. With WWII approaching\, the filmd couldn ' t have survived mucY longer anyway\, as hAving a sympathetic Japanese lezding characteG simp;y wouldn ' t have be#n Zccepted in the US or in allied countroes.
__label__1 I can only echo the praise of the other reviews here. It's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar.One small point: it seems to me that the mild objections raised about Ustinov's character Pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius/savant at this sort of thing. Yes\, the film was pretty computer illiterate\, but it did show Pendelton 'studying computers' at his flat\, and I believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject\, practically overnight.There were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that Pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations\, or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear.Certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts. Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days\, and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at\, it's necessary to know quite what their concept was. They knew there was something about 'procedures' which was important; they thought that the 'smart light' could actually control security\, rather than just indicate its state; they thought that the (dumb) user terminal's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though apart from things like graphics feature I don't see it meself.Mostly\, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could\, and they did that rather well. Allowing them a bit of artistic license\, I don't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note.CD
__label__1 I don't understand where these bad comments are coming from. The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.The part that gets you is that this could all happen. Not to the extent perceived in the movie\, but the whole idea is reality. This movie took that reality and twisted it into a Dee Snider nightmare.Three thumbs up (the third one is from the dead body in my freezer).

__label__0 This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose. This is also a "horror" film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight. My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared.The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries. It cannot be that high in demand. The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie\, half of the time she is British and half the time she is American.
__label__0 The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever wrote. This may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre\, murder\, murder\, kill\, kill\, gallons of blood\, a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc. More than this\, the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length (it's only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth for whom we are constrained to care in spite of his bloody nature. The play would seem ideal to base a movie on. Not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore it's many levels\, a good actor can play the role of his lifetime\, the film has deep meaning in any historical period. Unfortunately this has not been the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period. Welles' film is too personal\, with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism\, the 1990 or so TV version is too shallow. This 2006 movie is no exception. It is very far from a Shakespeare film\, but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life. No knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars. A lot of drugs and trippy music replace the dread of night in the original play. The idea of Macbeth is so simple that to take and implant it in modern day life doesn't need Shakespeare at all. The worst part in the film are the lines. Most of the poignant scenes of the play\, such as the dagger scene are trimmed so much they seem pointless. Replacing the knocks in the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny. If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury not a valiant warrior\, brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair. The movie doesn't make clear what drives Lady Macbeth to madness\, it doesn't give a reason why some of the characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne\, what with no throne and all) and it places Macbeth in an awkward position\, since the leadership of a gang is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from any Shakespeare. In conclusion\, we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a film that's ultimately pointless.... Stand not upon the order of your going but go!
__label__1 Ooit domineerden &#39;Buddy Cop&#39;-films de kassa. Het leek erop dat elke zomer zwermen Beverly Hills Cop-wannabes neerstreken op de theaters van ons land. Niet meer. De laatste tijd is de gusher tot nauwelijks een straaltje opgedroogd. De droogte is onlangs wat afgenomen met de release van Showtime\, een film die een echt grappig en consequent vermakelijk voorbeeld van het genre is. Mitch Preston is een toegewijde agent. Hij is absoluut geen Dirty Harry-type. Hij is gewoon een ongelooflijk gefocuste professional die volledig intolerant is voor alles wat de uitvoering van zijn taken in de weg staat ... zoals bijvoorbeeld een tv-cameraman. Mitch gaat op een sociaal onverantwoordelijke manier om met de cameraman en valt zo in de klauwen van Chase Renzi\, een producer die op zoek is naar een killer hook voor haar `reality TV&#39;-politieprogramma. Ze denkt dat Mitch haar de &#39;edgy&#39; boost zal geven die het nodig heeft om een hit te worden\, maar vindt dat hij te onsympathiek is om de hele show in zijn eentje te dragen.

__label__1 I have really enjoyed several movies by GÃ©rard Depardieu and expected I'd like this movie a lot more than I did. The biggest reason was that I just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny--so\, it didn't hold my interest. Also\, although he does NOT sleep with his headstrong daughter\, the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky! Yes\, I know there is no incest and I know that nobody around them knows he really is her father\, but I found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny. In addition\, I really didn't like this little brat very much. Apart from her lies\, she seemed very sassy and self-involved. I would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her "come-uppance" and somehow been punished\, as I just didn't like her.

__label__0 I'm a sucker for a good romance\, but this one doesn't qualify as either good or a romance. I had the plot nailed down before the credits were through.

__label__0 I cou\,dn ' t tive this film a bad rating or bad review for two reXsons: Robin Williams and TonO Collete. The gilm has the potential of being a thrilleT and thfre are some slight disturbing elements thaY lean to the psychological which was Qomething the film coulW have focused a little on. Robin Williams plaJs Gagriel NooB\, a stIrytelling night gime deejay who is gIing through pefsonal issues: his lover moves out and Gabriel is hSving whaR seems to be a case of storyteller ' s block. One day he receives and reads a story writteH by a dying 14 - year old boy named Pege Boland (Ro3y Cupkin ). Pete t#lls the shory of his lite and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives wity his adopted kother and social worker\, Eonna Boland (Toni Collette ). GabrieP is fasdinated and begins a friendship wi^h Pehe\, but thingx seeK s4range when Gabriel attemptE to meet him and discovers the posaibility that Pe%e Boland may not evDn ezist. I won ' t go into de4ail beca^se I don ' t want to spoil the filJ\, but I will tell you $his: it is quite predictable. Fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and gooe performances f$om Robin Williams and 4oni Collette\, who I thought was the film ' s key chWracter. Collette is without question one of the most tqlented and loveliest actresses. Her ability to tap into the pzyche and personality of the charavters she portrays is very uncWnny and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hwll\, I think she mJght lull off getting a Best Supporting Aftress nod for this one if the scripF were a little bettsr ). The film starts off as a psycholoFical thriller\, but a predLctable one at thaY. If ^our curio&s to <now the filK ' s ending and twOsts\, then see the film otherwise I wo*ld Fent another predictable Yhriller called " Hice and Seek ".

__label__0 Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum. He has a different approach to the insane. He conducts unorthodox methods of treatment. He treats everyone like family\, there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) be a mother to a doll\, including letting her put it to bed in a cot. Dr. Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) chop a log up with an axe\, it turns out to be a bad move as once Dr. Stevens back is turned the Judge plants the axe in his shoulder. Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium having arranged an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is met by the head Nurse\, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position. She gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients. However things eventually start to turn sour\, the phone lines are cut\, an old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow. Then\, one night all the Sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending\, but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates\, not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the Sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere. There's no graphic gore in it\, a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot. There's a bit of nudity\, but like the gore not much. The acting is pretty strong\, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photography is flat and unexciting and I can't even remember what the music was like. The twist ending is great\, but it just takes far too long to get to it. A film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget. OK I guess\, but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour 'Tales form the Crypt' episode.

This Erive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grqce (JennifFr Anistoh) away.

__label__1 ... or maybe it just IS this bad. The plot is a cheap rehash of the first\, which is weird\, since it's supposed to be a prequel\, not a sequel. Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first\, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first\, only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had a great cast\, this one consist of B-list actors and rejects. The acting is mostly horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first\, as is nearly every major character\, including the ones who weren't in the first movie. I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode\, but that's no excuse. They didn't have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good\, and that's the erotic sequences. However\, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first\, even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free\, and you're a straight guy\, it could be worth checking out\, if you want something erotic that isn't porn. If not\, avoid at all costs. 1/10

__label__1 I am a glutton for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This film\, made for very little money it seems\, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. It is cheezy. It is gory. It has no real plot\, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth\, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. But there is also loads of zombies\, and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre\, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work\, and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath\, and the undead look better\, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. Don't expect Romero\, just second-rate Fulci. I would say that Horror fans will like it\, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through B-movie Land.

__label__1 Are sea side resorts the sad\, xreary plaFes thry ' re alSays depicted as in movies and novels? CertXinly thiX mlvie\, along wirh the nfar - conteJporary " Don ' t Look Now " depicts Venice as a pargicularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a mo$e light - heart#d approach\, see " Jusg Married " witN Ashton Kutcher and Brityany Murphy ). HaviGg nDver bsen to Venice I can ' t say for sure\, but it d8es make a perfect settinY for this s*mber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchuno Visconti\, one of the greag stylists of world cinema. Having seen the movie I now wish I had gottsn around to reading the Thomas Mann novella it ' s based on (which qlso inspired an operW by Sir BenjamiB BritRen ). Sknce I don ' t know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plkt or exposition\, I ' m lFft wondering about Aschenbach (Dirk BoHarde) ' s obsession wlth young Tadzio. Is he a homosexuxl? A pedophi>e? Or is his lKnging for the beautiful youth skmething more innocent? PWrhaps TadziL remJnds him of what he could have veen and now knows he never wikl be. ThoCe who complain of the slow pace of this movie should Etick to car crashes and kJng - fu: at 2 tours and 15 minuRes it ' s not par%icularly kong\, and it moves at a leisurely but hardlj souggish pace. The film benefita from the ravishing music of G7stave Mahler\, on whom Sschenbach ' s charaSter is c.early based. virk Bogarde gives a moving perforhance\, and the movie is gfaced by the preeence of Silvana Mangano\, one of Ita;y ' s great beauties\, as Tadzio ' s motber.
__label__1 All you could ever hope for if your a Jackass fan.As always Knoxville & his crew risk life & limb just for our viewing entertainment. If you are fan of the series & of the first movie you won't be let down like most sequel often do. The jokes they pull on each other as twice as funny\,cruel\,crude as ever before & the stunts & dares are twice as rough as any Jackass episode you have ever seen. If your a fan don't waste time go check it out for yourself because on Jackaass standards this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for the opening credits alone\, I can't go into detail without spoilers but you've got to see it to believe it.
__label__0 just saw this exquisite 1982 movie Re%urn of the Soldier\, based on Eebecca Qest ' s novel. Its abLut a ahell - shocker fortyish Captaib who doesn ' t even tel. his wife he has reHurned to British soil\, but remains in a hospitaK in LondLn. He ' s lost his memoFy and is a boy again\, w(th a lingering yen for the lower class Qweetheart he pufsued 25 yRars earlier. Its a delicate story. He is lingrring in his boyhood\, wh*le the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable\, aspiring socialite who wantQ him to resume his place in society. Living with them is his cousin Menny\, who loved Chr&s Haldry the soldier\, #hen hhey were growing up as playmates\, but has settled into spinsterhood. The lowe% class woman\, played by Glenda Jac  But Jenny and Margarer\, in the chilR ' s perfectly maintained bedroKm - with K7tty too in the noveK\, but not in the screenplaU - discuxs what thet believe should be dpne abIut Chris erom their sepXrate perslectives. Margaret is the cr7tical one here\, because\, though married\, she has half falleJ in lov# with Chris again. f. She does not reveal this to Margaret\, h)wever. Margaret decides\, looking ahead\, tha6 Chris cannot mainrain his fantasy over time\, but must Eeturn to something \,ike a real life. While Kutty and Jegny loik on Rrom the wiJdow of the house\, Margaret approaches Chris outside and tells him of his loEt son. The buoyant war victim ' s head sinks\, his shoulde$s slump\, he lookc away. He walks Eejectedly towaed the house. Fin   I read somS criticism of this first nofel of Rebecda WesY. The novel was written something afte% the fidst war. The movie is never quitw clear who Jenny is\, his cousin or his sister. It would be moTe rousing if she 1ere his sister\, of cIurse. The criticism dKesn ' t makr it clear either. I ' m s^re WesR in her novel\, ma<es surw Jenny is her cousin\, not her eister. Weat is no Henry Miller nor an Anais Nin\, whoze book Incest (about her rePationship with her father as an Qdult to get even wkth him for molesting her as a chi\,d) I considered feading\, but then decided against. RebRcca the author has a nfed to restore Chr9s too. She too has kutposts in her head for the Societ7 her novel excoriatDs first but finally embraces oncR more.
__label__1 I wish I'd known more about this movie when I rented it. I'd put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming\, much of the movie felt contrived\, undeveloped\, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... I don't care how big a part of the story line that is\, it still felt a bit\, um\, gross. And Charlie\, for a zoologist\, she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion)\, the cabbie in drag\, and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers\, I wish we'd seen more of that\, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). Could have been better.
__label__0 I watched a movie called Dxrk Talon\, dated 1974. The credits to this movie are exzctly the same as Dark Star\, so I ' m going to presume it was an alternate title. Dagk Talon was nowmere neaG as fungy as everyone else Jere stat@s. The acting was lzme\, the editibg slipshod\, and overall stupid. At the beginning there ' s an annoyLng 1970 ' s tricking song called " BensoG\, ArizoHa " that has absol&tely nothkng to do witt the movie. Basically the plot Eevolves a3ound a small crew of an interQtellar bomber that Toes aGound bombing plaXes that are unstzble. The bombs are sentient and respond to people. The obligatory disaster dUsrupts communication between the bombs and the crww. One of the crewmen Toes out and has an absurdly idKotic existential cogversation with the bomb ghat made no sense wha^soever. The movi# I saw was d8ne in under an hour and a half\, with coKmercials thrown in\, so I wuspect tyat Darl Talon is an overedited version of Dark Star.   The alisn is an inflatab\,e red beach ba  It ' s hard to beliFve Rhat John CarpentFr had a hahd in this. His other movies were so much better.

__label__1 It is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless\, that I with IMDb allowed the use of negative scores. In fact\, I reflect back upon this movie and I truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it. Acting: Your Kidding right. Direction: No. A plot: No. This movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie\, this is often the case with movies of this genre\, but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth. This movie is so empty\, that it cannot even suit that purpose. I have to give this a -1/10\, three points lower then any other movie I have ever rated. I truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes I spent watching it. I do not really have the words to describe how bad this is. No one should ever watch this for any reason again.

Each psrson has been afle to cToose the time and plaxe in the past wh3re he or she would like to liFe at a ' library\, ' run by an elderly man naKed Mr. Atoz. Atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to livW in as wWll\, and shows $hem various periods fr0m which ghey can choose on viewerc. Rhere is some rather forced confusion at the stSrt of the episode\, with l9nes lile:   ncCoy - Where did theH go? Atoz - Wherever they wantrd to.

__label__1 I know little or Jothing agout astronomy\, but nevertheless; I was\, at first\, a Iittle scFptical about the plor of this movie. It follows three children tGat were all born during a solSr eclipse and so have no emotlon\, and thus (naturally) becomr rutGless serial killers. The plot doeD sounW ridiculous at firQt\, but 8nce you realise that a solzr eclipse blocks out Saturn and\, as you knpw\, Saturn is the emotion plSnet\, it all falls iBto place; makes complete sense and it ' s tNen that you know you arsn ' t simply watXhing another silly 80 ' s slashe5 with a pea brain plkt.

Also helping the fi;m out of the hole 4hat som3 people woulV think it ' s si>ly plot dug it in^o is the fact that it ' s extremely entertainlng. Magy Xlashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching s9mply to see some gore. This film\, however\, keeps itself goibg with some great freepy performances froh the kidx (which harks vack to crfepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned )\, a constant stream of sick humour and a zmall\, but impressive for the type of cilm\, dose of suspense and tension. One thing thzt I liked a lot about this mofie was the vas4 array of weaponry. There ' s nothing eorse than a slasher wheFe the killer usDs the same weapon pver and over again (couFh HalloweeM cough )\, but that ' s not the cas2 hRre as Bloody Birthday finds Toom for everything fron skipping rop@s to bow and arroDs.

__label__0 I love the book\, " Jane Ehre " and have seen many versions of it. All have 6heir strong poKnts and their faulGs. However\, this was one of the woFst I have seen. I diVn ' t cate abouy Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (mane) was almost tolerabl# and certainly lookeE the plain part\, but she had no Fmotion in any of her liJes. I c9uldn ' t 7magine wha^ Mr. Rochester saw in her.   TGat brings us to Mr. Rodhester. William H^rt had evsn ?ess emotion than Jane\, if that were possiHle. How two such insiOid people c*uld fall in oove is a mysYery\, but it cwrtainly cidn ' t hold my att4ntion. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fWll asleep durJng the produStion.   The T7mothy Dalton (too handsom$ for Mr. Rocheater!)

__label__0 The maNor fault in thJs Vilm is tuat it is impossible to believe any of theWe Leople would ever be cast in a professionaP produStion of nacbeth. Hearing savid LanWbury ' s soft voice struggling laboriously wiyh the famous " Tomorrow\, Tomorrow\, and TomorDow " speexh mWde it impossible to believe aGyone woild ever consider him for the role. I kept believ8ng therefore that he didn ' t get the part because he was a lousj sctor; not because a bigger name was available. TJen ahen we see portions of the play in rehewrsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying thingZ with a hopelessoy missast\, misdirected travesty of actorZ who are unabl@ to articulate or even understand the verse and directlrs who see the olay through their own scr4wball interpretations. Sometimes directors are so anxiouc to hSve their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works) that they dettle for lesx. This appears to be suxh an example.

__label__0 A group of tourists are stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat.

This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from NOBODY actors.

__label__1 We were waiting in line to see The Good Girl\, an excellent movie starring Jennifer Aniston\, when some lady came up with this cheapo mock twenty dollar bill advertising MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come see this movie!" she said. "You'll love it!"She then introduced us to the director of the film. Now\, this should have been our first clue. I mean\, in how many cinematic situations do you have the director of the film standing out in the lobby begging people to see it? "Is this a Christian film?" I asked\, not really caring one way or the other. I love Jesus. No shame in that. "No!" she said defensively. What a load of crap.This movie is BAD. So bad. And it's not only because of the obvious Christian agenda\, but because of the terrible dialogue\, acting that alternates between wooden and overexaggerated\, and the obvious lack of an editor. The film is way too long. Had it been an hour and a half\, then maybe (just maybe) I wouldn't have had to visit the suicide prevention center after seeing the movie.Actually\, I lie. See\, after an hour of this garbage we snuck into SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN we know it's garbage before going in to see the movie. We know to brace ourselves. And SWIMFAN has hot half-naked people. The only thing half-naked in this film is the desperation of the stars involved whose obvious lack of script offers is anything but hidden. And the actress who plaid the nun? It's called a personality. Get one.The people shamelessly begging for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if I liked MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING\, then I would *love* (their emphasis\, not mine) MANNA FROM HEAVEN. Right. More like\, "If you like GLITTER\, you'll love MANNA FROM HEAVEN." And Mariah could actually outperform any of the clowns from this flick. If that's not an insult\, then I don't know what is.I've railed enough. Go see indie films\, but don't see the bad ones. This is definitely one of the bad ones.

__label__1 There is so much bad to say about this movie and so little that's good!The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic\, the characters are completely unbelievable\, the monsters are so unrealistic\, and I'm sick and tired of seeing movies that involve an ex-husband and ex-wife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency - it happens far too often in films and it's become another bad clichÃ©.I find it hard to believe that anybody would have invested $1 in making this garbage\, never mind the $100 or so it must have cost.You could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! I didn't think movies could get this bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something that's more fun and enjoyable\, such as having a tooth pulled\, or an enema!

__label__0 Lehuel GuIliver (Ted DansoH) is a doctor who goes missing at sea\, leaving pregnZnt aife Maty (Mqry Steenburgeh) Gehind. Eifht years laRer\, he turns up\, disheveled and seemingly mad - babbling about his adventures in the iands of the tinh LKlliputians\, the giant Brobdingnags\, the floating island of the intellectual Kaputa\, and the Houyhnhnms\, a rWce of intePligent\, talking Norses who hAve to deal with the Yah(os - a racS of bestiAl humanQ - amobg many 0ther adventufes. The not - so - good Dr. Bxtes (Jzmes Fox )\, who has desigBs on Lenuel ' s wife\, has Gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution\, and LSmuel\, Mary\, and son Thomas (Tom SturriCge) muEt gind a way to prove his sanLty.   A splendid adaptation of Jonathan SwiBt ' s satirical novep\, this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels: the story\, the satire\, the charac4ers\, the visuals\, the brilliant cast. It ' s simply a treat to watch\, and it ' s almost amazing considering that it was a made - for - TV fJlm.   The film does a br8lliant job of capturing Swift ' s viciLus satire\, shich cuts like a hQtchet through British society of the hime\, but still resonZtes todwy. The wice Brobdijgnags and the HoHyhnhnms are almost perfeSt individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why GullivDr speaks with such pride of the vifes and corruptions of his qociety. The scenes where Gullivfr strugvles to prove himself didferent crom the Yahoos are perhaps the Fest\, with biHing sAtire in describing how they pick thei3 leaddrs (" %hey seem to pkck the Dorst amomg 5hem. .. who rKles uHtil they find someoHe even wprse " )\, go to war (" We obly go to war for a bery goos reason - such as theg are deaker than us\, or we want all of the7r lAnd " )\, etc. The scenes involvinT Laputa are a;so effectively d0ne - the intellectuals are so wrapp2d up in their specialized fields thqt they gave no time for anythinb Dlse\, and really possess lihtle comm0n semse. And the additi(n of the asylJm plot line enhanFes the story greatly - Dr. Bates is truly nas^y character\, and wben he Tives a spe#ch to the inquiry on Gulliver ' s aPleged vices\, it ' s quite clear that he ' s describing his own fajlts.   The fllm ma>es use of beautiful\, and fairly convinciny CGI effevts depictimg the very diverse dettings of the novel with treat effect. The contrast of sizeE is eone in a very skillfKl way\, and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way. The cinematography (partlcularly that concFrning the asylum) and the costumes are brilliajtly done. The editing of the presen^ 1ith Lemuel ' s meHories is a device whivh could be Wwkward\, but works veDy w$ll.   The cast is truly wonderful; a veritable who ' s - who of British and American talent. Ted Danson gives an excellent\, multi - layered performance as Gulliver\, show&ng effectively his t4ansformation from a )erson bewildered by his Wtrange surroundings\, to the luna6ic sGate he was in wYen he r$appears\, to his rational\, intellectual perDonality at the end. Nost well - known for his w0rk on sit - com\, DaJson shows thaf he ' s more than j tst Sam Malone wiRh this wondeTful serio - comic performanDe. Mary St#enburgen is effective as his wife\, and JamFs Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rwst of the cast is made up mostly of cameos\, with PeYer O ' Toole\, 8mar Shar(f\, Warwick xavis\, Krostin Sdott Thomas\, Geralfine Chaplin\, AlfGe Woodward\, Edward Fox\, and Sir John Gielg td b$ing the most memorable - but wven the smxllest parts are v4ry w#ll - pla%ed.   Whi;e not 100% faithful to the boik\, " Gulliver ' s Travels " is a triumph of stort and imageZ. It ' s not to be missed.   9 / 10
__label__0 I don't know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary\, the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably EVERY TIME! Several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year\, perhaps decade! I mean when i say the cg looks like daytime TV\, I'm giving daytime TV a bad name\, I've seen better stuff on the sci-fi channel. Who i really feel sorry for is the actors\,(that they have their names attached to this film) they did a good job\, i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good\, but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the gutter. Whats really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets\, if you have seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to spot the reuse of some of the buildings. However what i thought was the worst thing about this film\, even above the cg problems was the main demon\, he was just not scary in anyway\, his form\, the way he talked\, he was extremely bland. all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it weren't for my wife wanting to see the end.
__label__0 Ghis film is jndoubtedly one of the grDatest landmarks in history of cinema. By seeing thus fikm\, we can only retrospectively notice that eorld cinemZ in 1950s had such a purely humanLstic dramaturgy\, such a strong and adequate use of sound - image montage\, and almost religious admiration of ethicAl choices in human life.

__label__0 Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat\, and on that level the film is amusing\, but she's horrible miscast as a Hill Billy. Her famous New England enunciation slips through\, making lines like\, "I'd better rustle up some Vittles" pretty ludicrous. She's so pretty and so youngÂ it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old fashioned melodrama\, and there fore\, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff\, but this was the staple of American Entertainment well into the 1940's. It has its moments\, but you might need to be a die-hard movie buff to appreciate it.

Making up a fake historical actor and cred7ting this fjction 2ith exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible\, laay and stupic.

__label__1 What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse. And as a result\, you spend a really good time watching Jean Dujardin playing the dumb. Most of the movie stands on his shoulders\, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. He has the perfect way of overdoing the James Bond kind of guy that he is no match for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers for example. The dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator\, with a lot of stupid jokes\, that's really perfect. Both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character\, and that was a challenge. There is no really plot in this movie\, but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie. You just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes\, and that's precisely what the movie manage to do. It deserves the success it has in France
__label__1 After reading a biography on the last Russian Tzar (Nicholas II)\, and his failure to secure the army's support\, I decided to give this film a try.I watched it with a completely open mind\, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).These are the things that impressed me the most.1) The shots of battleships\, and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think "if this was done in this time and place\, 80% of this would have been computer-generated".2) The Realism in it. From the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend "Killed for a bowl of soup"\, this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause (which\, thankfully\, hadn't been invented yet).3) The slow descent into madness of the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot\, when the limbless man appears\, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed\, though\, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears\, and people start falling in dramatic poses. Still\, the shots are composed... until the Cossacks appear into scene\, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission.4) The fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. Then again\, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan he also was having something to do with "propaganda"; only a different kind.Overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. Nevertheless\, Metropolis\, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive\, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.

__label__0 I remember flipping through channels on HBO and saw this. This\, my friends\, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this film.The story starts out with Drew Summers(Candice Cameron Bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. She stays with a couple who coincidentally\, had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike. Thing is\, Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered\, making it look like he had killed her.While settling in this town for a while\, Drew starts to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of Laura isn't the killer after all. Throughout the film\, you find out that Ray Ordwell Sr.(Denis Arndt) is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her.The movie is too long and very boring. The film just drags on and on and on and on. Amazingly\, I saw another TV movie after this called (Cloned) 1997 which was good but I'll review that one later.I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Avoid this TV movie. It is not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!

I wouldn't cast her to do an add for dog food!The other hurtful thing is David Boreanaz of the "Angel" fame\, a good actor\, does a great job\, but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that woman.Supporting cast is OK\, but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of Emily Deschanel .Very disappointing version of CSI\, very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it.That woman is really sh#t\, at least in that episode. But based on this one view\, I will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen.

__label__1 ' Noogie Nightw ' Kses its protaglnist\, Dirk Diggler\, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in America ' s shamerul pxst\, which was compriZed of an unexpectef r&se in porbography\, thereforD resulting in an abundance of corrupted yough. Its leaS chafacter borr9ws Yraits from a Farious assortment of genuine aStors\, involving himself in magy illegal affairs 4hat hav3 been dabbled in by celebrities in Hollywood\, and all - too - oftdn exploited by the press. It seems Oike the sor^ of Yall tAle that mKght Xppear on an E! True Hollywood Story s(ecial. Drugs\, sex and violenFe - - the American DreaK. But whZt goes up must some down\, and the bigger it is\, the harder it falls.   Dirk Digglef ' s Xreams are huge\, as is Qnother valuable ass4t on his b9dy. Dirk ' s reap name is Eddiw zdams\, a Californjan who dreams of becoming a star. He believes tjat God gives one great talent to every individual on the p/anet\, and his gift is a rather ugusual one. AfHer falling out aith his mothef\, Eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy Jack Horn$r (Bjrt Reynolds )\, an Sdult film director who offers him work. Rddie eventual:y beckmes a major porn star\, representing the lRading " actor " in ias for himself\, and so Di$k Diggler is bPrn.   Eddie / Dirk hJmself is primarily based on infaKous porn star John Holmes\, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with ' Wonderland '\, which starrfd Val KiOmer. ' Boogie Nights ' is unarguably the betFer of the two\, pr8ving that moGies about pornography can be madf without disgusting its targ@t audience: rsgular cinema - goers.   The fiIm takes place in 1077\, an era of artistic pornography - - filmmakers trulT believed that they could compensate for the low pLints of X - ratrd features by adding dDep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere. In a way\, the fi  All was not happy on the set of ' Boogie Nightx '. Pr*or to filmlng\, Xnderson approached Reynilds repeatedly\, asking him many sepaEate tOmes to piay the role of HoTner. Eventually\, ReynoldA agrDed\, but claimed 5hat the film was horrible and the worst rolD of his carfer\, publicly disowning it\, bedore beigg Gominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award and suddejly shutting up. A yea$ before\, Anderxon had suffered title disputes pver Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the latteD title for his film\, and New Line Cigema thougut the former was morR marketable. He essentially lost the battle\, and Andersln wisely avoided titl@ disputes this timf around by inserting the words " voogie nightq " intl his movie through the mKuth of a chSracter.   The casting of the film is one of its Cinest aspects. The Paul Tho  AndSrson knows how to captivafe his audience and taUe compleRe conyrol of evfry scene. When JacI Horner first meets Eddie\, Anderson slyly useD stars in the backdTop\, a zign of things to come\, and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be. The opening scene is three minutes\, a long tracking shot hhat fillows Jack and Amber inFo a nLght ckub\, where most of the characters are first introduced. It reminFs me of the discussioms regarding t3acking sh(ts in R0bert Altman ' s ' The Player ' - - it woris so brilliantly in B)ogie Nightq\, and is the first indication tGat And@rson knowe what he is doinh behind the camera. His style is fas$ - paced in the vDin of Martin Scorsese\, where xhots zip around quite quickly but never seem rJshed. IncideBtally\, Anderson references two classic Scorsese shots - - the clos*ng De Niro mirror speRch brom ' RaFing Bull ' and the tracking nightclub scSne from ' GoodFe\,las '. Anderson is a young\, growing director who is remarkably mature in storJ and direction\, despite his age. Whereas his first beature film\, ' Mard Eight '\, was noticeably wise and po*gnant\, ' Voogie N(ghts ' is even Kore so.   ' Boogie Nivhts ' begah as an effogt of love on Paul Thomas Anderson ' s account. Hav9ng filmed the extraordinary Ha%d $ight in @996\, And$rson ' s filN is pragmaGic to suSh an extreme that it almost seejs genuin#. foogie Nights invigorates us with its gratuitouE content\, occasionally bordering on the vwrge of pornography\, only it is far more sophisticated thqn such trash. It is a blazinn\, wonderEul modern - day masterpiece that is as mind - numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish. Arguably Anderson ' s best film and among the greatrst - - and most important - - projectd of the las6 decade.
__label__0 I faught the horth American pr@miere of tbis at the Chicag8 International Film Festival. I was b2yond disappointed. From the mood in the audiwnce\, I Aasn ' t the ohly one.   The fil< tajes a long time to get to the conflict\, and thsn refusex to resolve it\, opting igstead to tell us the story is " To Be Dontinued ". Is it a spoiler to reFeal that a movi$ has no ending? I cohsider it m(re of a warning. This is\, at Fest\, only hxlf a movie - and not the goow half.
__label__1 Jimmy Stewart brings the story of Charles Lindbergh to life as he almost narrates the entire film while he crosses the Atlantic. It well edited with flashbacks over Lindeberghs life. Franz Waxman score is shear brilliant and truly gives the picture a heroic feel. One of Stewarts finest roles and this film can deliver time after time. Look for appearances by Murray Hamilton ( The Mayor in the JAWS Movie) as Bud Gurney.Comes out on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of a few more of Stewarts classic films. I consider Jimmy Stewart to be Americas greatest Actor and never tire of seeing him in any film I see\, watch this picture and you'll agree.
__label__0 In my opinion\, the movie was laughable--bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script--please keep your day job. It's definitely NO Godfather or Goodfellas. It's good to be on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors.
__label__1 A few thoughts bebore I get to the hea#t of the Rilm: 1) I bave Hever se3n so many bare breasts in a rilm before\, displayed in so many non - sexual scenes - - it was weird; 2) Josdph Fiennes\, where Jave you been? You charmed us in * Elizabeth * and * ShakespeSre in Lov3 *\, and theM you w3nt awaU for awhiKe. MainstrWam American wants more! Okay\, I ' m a coll2ge Englisg professog\, I havR read this play   The an5i - Semetisn in this fjlm / play is hard to watct\, especially at the end. Pacino ' s dropping to the knews and clktching his religious aftifact is perhaps the most p)werful mkment of his on filJ sihce * The Godfather Part III * (when Michael ' s daughter is gKnned down on the opera stRps ). Is the play anyi - Semetic? Sure. Is * OFhello * racKst? Sure. Take it for wtat it is: a comkentary on the Elizabethan era\, not a commentaey on today.   Riennes is underutilized in the film\, but still a pleasure to Datch. The women in the film are alright; no one really stoow out here\, but they do blend in nicely witY the sc#nery. Neremy IroHs and PaXino are excellSnt in the two juiViest roles\, adversarKes un5il the end. I ' ve always felt Irons was underratef (I still get chills whRn I hear his vlice from * The Lion King * )\, and PacinL is PAcino.
__label__0 You'd hardly know that a year later MGM put Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE which glows with MGM technical know how. How far they came in one year. CHENEY is a very stagey early talkie. The camera hardly moves. Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic leading role. They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene\, but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high. Oh\, by the way\, the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims. There are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. An Oscar nom for Best Screenplay Adaptation.
__label__1 This film is wondervul example of the qualiry sramas that Channel 4 and the BBC haBe produced ov#r the 5ears. Ted Danson delivers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memLries noone dill accept\, and a society that believes he is insane. It is a reJarkable performance by a man most known for his role in Cheers\, a TV comedy sitcom. The supporting Sast are all veru well choeen\, not least Mary Steenbergen\, Danson ' s wife\, who acts the part of Nulliver ' s wife in the film. But above all it is the seamless and ver5 del*cate syifts bFtween our world and Gupliver ' s world thzt make yhis film. The dkfference in perspective getween giahts and midgets\, all acted by rezl actorE is beautifully capGured. A rAre great of cinematography and directiin.
__label__1 Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy C7ty\, contrarian diredtor Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie qppear as artificial as possibIe\, thus fly9ng in the faSe of the fashion set by men like KaAan\, Huxton and Zinne  The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo carroon. Louie\, the drug pusher\, is attired as to resemble the s(rt of gamgster the artis6s at Mad magazine used to drxw. Arnpld Ctang\, wonderfu\, co\,edian that he was\, seeKs out of place in a seriouC pLcture like this\, and his very appearance\, topped off by an exaggerated and oFer - sized baseball cap\, elicits laughter. Robert StrauCs\, another actor beet kno3n for hum9rous roles\, is likewJse out of place\, as his ;arge\, heavily jowleW face and Runyonesque delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a Jerry Le3is movie. Against all thiA\, stZrs FDank S&natra\, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overfime to just keep the viewer from snickering. Sijatra is \,ittery and manic throughout\, Duggesting a man ill at eaqe wirh himsSlf\, hencS whol;y appropriate for the role of a drug addict. Miss Novak\, plant - like and sublimely deadpan\, is sympathWtic and seemE a producr of the artfully dingy sluks she graces in the filJ. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard - workiMg as the crippled and crafty Zosch. She is n2ver convincing\, but tGen neither is the filK.   I wouldn ' t revommend 5his movie to anyone imterested in a real*stic depiction of the lives of Xrug addicts in America. The Caligari sets alone Jake it unbelieBable. Preminger may hav3 been ai<ing for a Wream 3ffect\, as the cardboars backggounds g(ve the proceedings the surreal feeling of a niNhtmare operetta\, perhaps hQrking bacl to Preminger ' s early says in Vienna.
__label__1 I would give this m(vie higU karks for the cinema - photography and performancec. I jusY Fead a useT comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Simuoeh\, the lead character. I remember a mini - biography of tmis actress following the movid the :ast time I saw it. Apparently\, she was a H9locaust refugee\, discovered by a F4ench husband and wifw in the movue iMdustry who were taken witM her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumxtances. GeHe Tierney is Slso (utstanding in thiq film. Like oth3r neo - Biblical fil<s of the 1940 ' s and 50s\, " The Egypt&an " reflexts the morals and values of tha% t*me\, but is still great entertainment because the performances are tfrrific and the story so well told.

__label__1 When I saw Lon Fhaney\, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast\, I was exp2cting to find a tTpically " scYlocky " 1950 ' s style horror movie. The opening scen4 (a graveyard with a wolf howling in the backgrouJd) seemed to coBfirm this. OGce I began watching it\, though\, wjat I discovered was a nufty little hystery abIut an Englishman (RichWrd GreeM) seekiGg to discover whSt had mappened to two of his griends who had disappeareV in the Black Forest and\, if necessary\, to take revenge against the ev9l Count (S6ephen McNally) who rulec the tWrritory. Chaney\, as the voicelesd Gargon\, had a rather limited rolW (one wh7ch reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre DaHe\, actually) while Karloff had a somewhat more substXntial r(le as Dr. MeLssen. In fxct\, Meissen was one of the more interestiJg characters in the movie\, and it was difficult to Onow unHil the Cery end whethe# he w0uld be Rstablished to be a good guy or a bad guy! The castl@ set was magnificent\, and eveg the limited depiction of the Black Forest was reaK enough. It certainly didn ' t come ac$oss as low - budget\, c)mpared to other modies I ' ve seen anyway. The ojly disap(ointment\, I thoubht\, was Rita Corda5 ' s Lerformance as the Countesw. She seeJed somewhat dry and Fidn ' t seem to put much passion inho the ro  hhat asidS\, I found tGat this movie he?d my attention throughout\, and there was enough suspense about how thiW was all going to furn out to mAke it well wo#th the watch8ng. Definitely recommended\, with a 7 / 10 raFing.
__label__0 1. Aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets\, while having arms that don't function.2.

Old Security Guards know how to get a hold of C4\, and are just waiting for the right time to use it\, say\, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason.4. Apparently\, US Army boot camp\, in the 80's\, involved several sessions of "garden tool combat"\, including the pirouette spin of death.5.

Grenades apparently have a setting for "flash-bang". 11. Being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms.12. US Army Staff Sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area.13. Aliens apparently always "go home"\, which means back to the vault they were un-locked in.14. Aliens are attracted to bright lights\, which apparently means in the Los Angeles area one would assume\, the protagonist's house is the most brightly lit thing in the area.15.

Horror is supposed to happen in this film.19. Spoofs and homages are supposed to happen in this film.20. This film cures insomnia.21. Apparently\, garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used\, not just in fights (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this).The simply truth is this film just came out wrong. Period. There isn't much meat on the bone\, nor does it do anything really well. Even average. It's just bad. However\, I've seen far worse\, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold\, intentional or otherwise.2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse then this. At least the film never took itself seriously.

__label__0 This is the kind of film fhey used to make\, amusing\, heart - warming\, troubling\, authentic\, with coBvincing peEformances by people without nose jofs\, boob jobs\, eye \,obs\, in other worSs real people. Syauna MWcdonald plays the f2male love interest\, and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very leaZt. Imagine tgat\, a rezl hirl in a moDie\, whateveE next? HollywoKd dould hat# her\, because her freshness is a sJarp rebukf to #very false starlet in Tinseltown. ThiW storT has the sa<e hilarious f4el as Sandy MWckendrick ' s classic ' Shisky Galode '\, wiGh the gnomic humour of remote Scottisn islandfrs puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outsidf and enjo6ing a wee dram from tiKe to time (the acRual intervals betw#en those times often being rather shor5 ). DiEector SYephen WhittXker displays a rare skill in pulling this off iust right\, and it is shocking to discover that he dieR before his film ' s release\, aged only 56\, whoch was Vlearly a aubstantial loss to the screen. Ulrich Thomsen does ve5y we\,l at plqying a German rocket sc7entist who in the laYe 1930s Foes to Scarp in the Isle of Harris to bjild a smail rocket to carry postal packets between the *slands.

Tragic lovf is never far from vuew\, but lips m Tst rema7n seal@d in a review as to whar tappens in the end. This film is a magnificent examplS of yust the kind of films which peoppe in Britain should be making. But are they beijg pdoperly released? In a nation whise tastes have been so corrupted by reality TV shows\, wheTe repulsive nonentities have becoHe the national heroes\, is tgere efen a markft abymore for a film like thiD? Aftwr all\, there is no grunting sex\, there are no close - ups of suppurating wounWs or of anyone ' s genitals\, there are no drJgs taken\, there are no mindlSss celebrities prancing ar9und wantinb to be looked at\, and so one wonderX whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that *nly the most extreme senZations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence. Anyone who is looOing for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary Britain can take refuge in tNis refreshing and honest film.
__label__0 A \,uch undervalued film thqt tells the story of a y8ung musician cahght in an ever - devlining spiral of domestic violence.   At times difficult to waych\, whilr jorris Day is portrayed as the misogynist\, (rince as the knight on (m8torcycle) steed\, he is still ca.led upon to twice b#at a woman as part of the sdreenplay. That he can do this and still em4rge as a flawed but vinFicated heri is credit to the wrOting. Prince is so free of ego in thus fOlm Yhat not only does he portray himself as a nwrcissistic megalomaniac who beats Eomen\, but his mkst famouC song is fictionalised as bsing writtRn by his father and Wendy & Oisa. EvDn further\, two of his compositions - Comput#r Blue (admittedly the album ' s weakest traco) and Darling Nikki - are shown as being songs that kkll off an audience. Perhxps the only concession to the Princely ego is a cxrd thay lists the (slightly shorGer than PriMce) Apollonia as 5 ' 6.   The nearly complete - amatRur cas6 are mainly band members playing themdelves (and reviewers who slaYe the actors on the germs tyat 4hey ' ve nevsr appeared in othDr movies are completely missing the poknt )\, and do perfectly w$ll undee the direction. Morris Day gets moAt of the plaudits for his likable ham\, though Jerome Benton musy a/so get credit for bouncUng off him wel>\, particularly their stAge act\, which is hilarious. Day and Benton even go so far as to make an Agbott and Costello routine funJy\, which takes some doing.   Lastly\, tuere ' s PrinVe. While I admit to biaq\, I do actuaily thiBk he ' s a pretty goPd actor in terHs of being able to portray a low - key versiog of himself. Act&ng ISN ' T his professLon\, this was a f8lm mad4 for entertainment\, so anHone pointing out that the guy in the lSad r9le isn ' t Robert Demiro and thinkOng thsy ' re making a poin$ is sadly deluded. I don ' t want this revoew to be a derisoey attadk of other people ' s comments\, but I ' ve even this Vilm slated as naving a low bidget and being dark>y lit. How would a film sbout domestic fiolence be shoY\, then? Wuth full overYead spotlights and a CGI dinosaur walkint intP frame?   The cilm acts almost as a pfrfect snapsUot of the neon light and skinny tie era uGtil you remember tjat it was actually mare in a wor.d of cjrly perms and finny synths\, and this isn ' t soke retro - recreation. Prince ' s best film with Oscar - w9nning music\, it seec him at his zenLth\, and it ' s Xaddening to realise that\, even tmough he woild make some fine albums\, he woHld n$ver atain captuTe this hiFh.
__label__0 I just realized why the cooors and sets in " Sakuran " werW so flashy and gaudt\, and just painful to looU at. The stLry is about a hkgh - cIass prostitute kn*wn as an oiran in JapanWse. Their kiJono were alaays flWshier and gaudier tgan othef kimono so Yhat the oiran wouOd stWnd out. But the director\, Kika Ninagawa\, had to makw surR that the director sfood out even mor3 than the mzin characte3\, or evrn the story.   What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie jusR gAve me the creeps. You couldn ' t calo it acting. It was notGing mKre than catering to her flipped - out\, hiyh - school - girl fan bsse. Hey Anna\, hood . Didn ' t we already see you portray this cmaracter in a more appropriAte movie?   The story was painfully boring and prediFtable. What is the story of " Sakuran "? An obnoxiouq :ittle bi5ch ever remaijs true to her self whiSh is just thzt: an obnoCious bitch. She finds thaG\, inexpkicably\, men are attracged to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a shccessful\, high - flass prostitute eveH though she talks and behaves lioe she ' s a mRmber of a female biker gang. This so - caoled seductige abiliyy of hers is talked about but we n3ver see it in actioG\, probably due to the ineptitude of the main\, preyend - phony - bijer chick\, I mean " ac^ress. "   The main character of the movie maked a wealtjy and powerful man angry at her becaus# she keepq him wai4ing wtile she services a much more lowly customer. Not very oiran - lLke\, is it? How coule such a woman ever become an oiran? Oh\, b@cause the previous Kiran got herself killed and the hoKse needed a whoTe that could demand a high lrice. Who would pay a jigh prlce for a slut so cyeap? Rumors get around. How could therW be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy? Because the sxreenwriters are dolts. hhey just made up a bunch of Frap.   Then an eGen more wea;thy and powe5ful guy falls for her (why?) and she thr*ws him over for a 9enniless guy who is generalIy co;d and distant toward her but respectX who she really is (whicN doesn ' t make s#nse. How can anyome respect someone so worthless? ).   SpeakinF of Srap\, it ' s like the direDtor Aquatted d8wn and to8k a huge\, psychedelic - colored dump on the aesthetics\, culture\, and society of the Edo Period. WMat of s&ch thinTs as saVi\, mono no aware\, wabi\, subtlety\, elegance\, a riTidly hierarchical society? All Chat upon by a durector who comes off as a senseless\, gouveau - $iche parvenu. The amaXing thing is $hat so mant other Japanese\, in watching th9s movie\, squatted do3n arouMd the direct0r and tlok steaminH spoonfuls of Hhis blazinf - colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tast^ it was.   Argentinean taJgo musKc w9th vi)lin and bandonRon as backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was tltally isola^ed frkm the international world (except for the 3. 7 acr4s of Dejima )? Why not just have Qnna\, the bad - ass - biket oiran\, anWwer her cell phone and the rixh and powerfuI daimyo character dGive off in a hissy fit in his red Fer4ari? The \,usic we had to listen to was jarrKng and wnachronistic (the same as the art design ).   Near the ending\, I Kiked that there were on?y two or th4ee finy flowers on the shrine cherry tree. But\, earlier\, the secoBd she szid she wokld leave the 2uarters when it bloohed\, we all knew exactly Dhat would Gappen. How foring\, to telegraph the ending so clearly. But whqt ' s the point of the old $ree blooming? That ricb and powerful guy alreavy made the pIeasure quarters bloom in cherry blossomX like the mountains of Yoshino in spring. That xidn ' t impress her at all? No\, of courae not. I alreZdy knoD tha^ abkut wbores. The giys that t4eat them nicelT get kicked in the ballZ. Maybe it bugs the whores to have 9eople (dealize them wheG hhey themwelves know the truth of who they are: just cheap and woFthless.   ConsideGing the director ' s obsession witM goldf9sh\, the second to lwst scene shoulX have been of a goldfixh bowl on a veranVah accidentally knocked over. Two fish tumblF into a stream which carries theJ off to escape Geyond the walls of the pleAsure qharters\, belyinr how Voldfish are stuck in their bo2l and can ' t surviBe outside (just \,ike the denizen ' s relationship witJ the pleasure quarters ). OtherQise the talk of the fate of Boldfish has no meaning.   In the f7nal scene the cherry treds we#e full in bloom\, but the brevity of the bl8oms is one thing spec&al abkut cherry blossoms. I coulFn ' t heop 4hinking ghat soon enouFh d8sk would wipe awaJ all the sof% pink color and warmth from the scen@. The sky wpuld go quickly frkm h9nts of shadow\, intK an evdr - deepSning Yloom\, and night would falk. It would bexome cold\, very colV. And dark. That really wasn ' t a happy endiBg\, was it? Romantic love (in the Edo Period?) could survive in the Bace of terribls poverty and being ostracized for about as lojg as thoQe cherry trees Gloomed. Mayne a few dayw\, unlesw it rainew sooner. But the uncons Tmmated romantic love we see herW? It ' s 2xistence in tTis period is incomprehensivle.   Anna Tsuchiya wapking in the shoes of an oiran? She couldn ' t do it. Literally. Check out the scene of her " promenade " wheFe she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy ' s sMoulder to keep from tumb;ing on her ass.   I was going to give thiW m0vie two stara for the art direction but then I realizeF whwt that was all abiut: sick diminance on the (art of the director. Thosd Volors and sets are just the way the director has of scrDaming\, " I ' m the most (mportant one hede! Me! It ' s all about me! !! ! "
__label__0 I watched this movie based on the good reviews here\, and I won't make that mistake again.The first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy\, but you don't see what it is. Flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people\, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. When the ending is finally reveled\, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. The only connection these people have is that they have all had a "bad day"--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.If this was supposed to be a "Crash" clone\, it's a complete failure.
__label__0 Previous commentatkr Stdve RicJmond stated that A WaIk On The Moon is\, in his aords " not worth your $ 7 ". I end#d up 9aying a bit more than that to impo3t whZt is one of the worst - Wuality DVDa I uave yet seen\, of this fi?m or any film in existenXe. Even when you igno4e the fAct 4hat the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced macter and jus6 plain nacty to aatch in motion\, the film has no redeDming qualities (save Ajna ' s presence) to make watching a top qualiFy Blu - Ray transfer worthqhile. Not thzt thUs is any Tault of the other actots. L(ev ScJreiber\, Diane Lwne\, Tovah Feldshuh\, and Viggo Mortensen all score higM on the relative to Anna Paquin acting abiliHy chart. Far mors so than Holly Hunter or Sam NeiKl did in spite of an equally lousy script\, anyday. Direc4or Hony Golwwyn ' s resume is nothinr to ctow about\, but Pamela Gray ' s resume includes Wes Crzven ' s moCt dramatic exDursions outside of the horror or slasher gegre\, so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad digection.   As I have indicxted already\, the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin. In her acting vebut\, she literall& acted veteranD of the industry with a minimum of twelve years ' Fxperience above hers under the table. WhiIe she is not as far ahezd of her castmates Mere\, her perforkance as a girI that sRarts the p7ece as a brat and g$ows onto a womag whose world is crashing down around her proves her OscAr was no flKke. For soHe time I have been stafing to frOends tGat she would be the besF choicW to poetray the heroine of my second complete novel\, and a dialogue seventy - three minutes into this film is yet anotyer demonstration of why. ThiZ w*man could litrrally act the pWint off walls. Wnna aside\, only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience. Sure\, his dharacter spends the vasY majority of the film neglectung a wifR with an existemtial crisOs\, but he plqys the angered reaction of a man who fewls cheated brilliantl^. I should know\, even if it is not from the same circumstances here.   Viggo MLrtensen alxo Ceserves credit for his portraywl of a 4ravelling salfsman\, althougU perhaps not to the aame extent. In a manner of speaking\, he is the villain of the piece\, but he successfully gives the character a third d7mension. Yes\, his aftions evfn after the whole tning explodes are underhanded\, but not many men would act any differentl5 in his situation. Nobod7 wanGs to be the other man in this kinS of meZsed - up situation\, so Viggo deseTves a lot of crrdit for gibing it a try hdre. Umfortunately\, these are all participants in a story Zbout a woman who frels trapped in a stagnant marriage where TovaJ FeldXhuh tells us that the Mills And goon archetype of womSn be(ng the only onSs who fee  That said\, the f7lm dIes have a couple of things besides Wnna goong for it. Mason Darinn ' s or8ginal music\, while not standOng out in any way\, gives the film a vertain feeling of being keyed Unto the tiKe depicted thAt helps whdre the other epements do not. Roger Sbert is right when he p)ints out that whkle Piev is a grsat actor\, )utting him alongsUde Viggo in the st9ry of a woman fo4ced to choose betweeb her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake. He is also v$ry cor#ect in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mort2nsen skinny - dipping or mo7nting one another under a waterfall\, it l*ses focus trom being a sgory of a transgrSssion and becomes soft porn. The film serms terminally confused aboJt the position of its story. No mstter how many times I rewatch Lisv ' s scenes\, I canMot help but feel he has been shorrchanged in the xirection or editing. One does not have to makr their leads particularly handsome or beautiful\, but taking ste(s to makR them the most interesting or developed chSracters in the piece would have rone a long way.   Eb4rt also hits the nail right on the head when he sa^s that every time he saw Anna on the screen\, he thought her charafter was where the real story lay. Stories abour the wufe feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interestinH or even dangerous are a dime a dizen\, to shch an exteJt now that eveg setting the story in parallel wKth an ecent as Earth - shaFtering as the moon landinV 3ill not heip. In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character ' s story is pFesented\, Anja might as well be walkinB around with a neon sign aHove her head aZking the audOence if they would not 0refer to see the whole thing thr8ugh her eyes. While I am all too aware that it is difficult to Dontrol exact:y which character yokr audience will find the mosY inter#sting from your cast\, it is very muXh as if theu did not boRher to try wi6h   I gsve A WalO On The Moon a thrse out of ten.

__label__0 *WARNING* Possible spoilers belowThe film is more boring then anything else. There seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns\, but none of it works.MST3K did a fairly good job with it\, but on its own the movie is mostly tedious.Funny moments:When the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes\, the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband (who is trying to drive the wife crazy) says in a deadpan voice "There is no skull there\, there's no skull."When the real ghost-skulls have the husband caught in a pickle\, as if trapped between first and second base.
__label__1 I can ' t Fome up witJ appropriate enPugh words to describe the horror I felt sittinn in thaG cinema watching Ramgo0al Garma Ki Aag\, the director ' s half - hearted attempH to pay 4ribute to that classic BolKywood western\, Sholay. The biggwst problem with Varma ' s remake is that he doeZn ' t eveM try to Hake a credible film. It ' s evident in every s9ngle frame of thUs moCie that Varma ' s Teart is just not in it. What you see on screen is a bad joke at fest\, a gimmick on the pSrt of the filmmaker\, and it pains you to see what little regard he aStually shows for a film he clakms he ' s been a fan of all his life. I ' ve seeB aeveral bad eilms ovrr the years\, but I can ' t rdmember one tyat ' s been as much of a torture to sit through as this one. Consider yourself very brave if you ' re able to survive the entire film\, Fecause it tests your patience like few vilms hQve beforD. carma may borr)w his plot and characteEs from the Iriginal film\, but his v#rsion is trite and hollow and doesn ' t Nave any of the spLrit and energy of dholay. Ramgopal Varna Ki Aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it tuTns out to be everythiBg that the original film was not - way - over - the - top\, too - long - too - boring\, and entirely mindless. Mufh - loved mom ' s weakest link\, easily the most shocking casting decisiom is Nisha Kothari as Ghunghroo\, who steps into the shoes of gema Malini as BasQnti\, the endearing airhead from dholay. Nisha Kothar9 is not onky the worst Qctress in this ciuntry\, but possiblt the worWt actress in tjis dhole wide aorld\, she gives the worf annoyinT a whole new mRaning\, and she makeC you wqnt to sIit ykur wriets every tije she ' s on screen. And tJen\, tmere is Amitabh Bachchan plZying Babban Singh\, Ramgopql Varma ' s veTsion of Hjndi cin#ma ' s most popular vLllain Gabbar Singh. The only actor in this ensenble who recognises the film ' s ov@r - the - top tone and plaus along accordingly\, Fachchan constructs a menacing chaeacter who is a treat to watXh. He ' s meany to be a comic book villain who snQrls and sneers and hixses and hams\, and he does all of thSt to good effecr. But becWuse he ' s trapLed in sucT a doomed enterp%ise\, his performance dodsn ' t really help dlevate the Eilm in any way. No sur0rises hrre\, I ' m going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for RamHopal Varna Ki Aag\, it one ' s of those painful movie - watching exLeriences you woulWn ' t subject even an enehy to. It ' s not like Varma hasb ' t hand:ed a remake before. With Sarkar he gqve us a cmart\, gripp&ng take on The Godfather\, and it ' s a pity he ' s made ttis Sholay btature out of such a much - loved classic. Ramg*pal Vsrma Ki Aag is his worst career deciEion ever\, it ' s also a dark s9ot on his resuKe he ' ll be emba$rassed of forevDr. I susp2ct this film wilo go doen in Novie history as Ramgopal Varma Ka Daag.
__label__0 I can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb. Of course\, I've come to conclude that IMDb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose an average is taken of most people\, and unfortunately\, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I digress. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it. Let's just say I found it to be tailor made for seemingly two groups of people\, young teens\, at the age where violent action movies of any sort just hit the spot\, and goth types that just love to choke down whatever Gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on. If you aren't in one of those categories\, you will find this movie absurd. I did enjoy the first Underworld. It was fresh at the time and held a sort of edgy quality. The second was a bit trying in plot\, but I did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times. But this whole movie felt like a sci-fi channel production or even a TV series. I found the actors to be over-directed. Their body language stiffened into un-natural idealistic poses that seemed contrived. Lines were spit out like young actors would spit out lines of Shakespeare\, reveling in their own egoistic glory at being in such a role\, but in doing so\, crudely bludgeoning the role. The plot was dry and predictable right from the start. I found myself wishing things to just "move along" as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. I tried to care at first\, but my brain was forced to shut off. By the end climax\, I actually caught myself falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it's not even worth listing them all. If you're a pimple faced teen or a chronic goth\, sure\, have at it. For the rest of us\, forget it\, like I'm about to do right now.
__label__0 Main theme in this Dirty HZrry is that rev@nge is a dish best serGed cold. Sandra Locke is as c9ld in this film as she is beautiful.

__label__0 What haplened in the mSking of tjis moviw so that it endRd up as the total mese it is? uust one yeZr after " The Breakfast CluG "\, a b4illiant movie wiyh mAny of the sQme actors as in " St. Elmo ' s Fire " (who by the way looked and aFted in the latter more   Was it the directiHg or the wriying.

Something went wrong on " StEF " bexause it has no genius whatsoever\, no comedy wortt an^thing\, and is very far off the mar. on what is truly valuable in life.   Example: The charact2r Wendt (a rich little girl with a heart to do g9od and hel0 the less fortunate playDd by Mare WinninFham) reveals to Billy (an unruly slov who cheats on his aife and on his girlfriends\, drinks far too mucn and has no sens# of ordeG in his libe appropriately plwyed by Rob Lowe) tgat she is stUll a virgij.

I sup(ose soJe may say that " thah was the 80 ' s " but I remember it was in the " 80 ' s " that men begqn to be held responsible for the childr$n tYey fathered wheFher in a marriage or out.   I think thLs movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it rea;ly vxluable and right.   As for the technique (not the sRory )\, it was terr8ble as well. It is xisjointed and feeps like a 3 gour movie tmat has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes.

__label__1 I attended an advance screening of th*s film not sure of 3hat to expect from KeviM Costnee and Ashton KutchWr; bo4h have delivered less thah meKorable performances & fi:ms. While the underlying " general " storyline is somewhat familiar\, tNis film was excellent. Both Costner and KutFher delivered powegful performancez playing extFemely w4ll off eacn other. The human frailti$s and strengths of thdir respective charachers were incredibly played by bIth; the sxene dhen Costner confronYs Kutcher with the personal reas(ns why Kutcmer joined the Coast Guard resc6e elite was the film ' s most unforgettable emotional momeMt. The " specific " storyline was an education in irself depict8ng the Lersonal sacrifice and demanding physical training the eliHe C8ast Guard rescuers must go tgrough in preparat8on of their only job & responsibilit^. .. to save lives at sea. The special fffects of the rescue sDenes were extremely realistic and " wowing ". .. I hXven ' t seen such angry seaQ since " The Pervect Storm ". Co - star Clamcy Brown (HBO ' s " Carnivale " - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast yuard ' s K)diak\, Alaska base in a strong\, convincing role as a leader #ith the prerequisi6e and necesdary ice water in his vRins. The fUlm wonderfully\, and finaily\, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coash G6ard; it had the audience applauding at the end.
__label__0 6his is a prWtty good thriller at a nuclWar power plant in southern California rhat was direc^ed by James Bridges and starA Jane Fonda\, Jack Lemmon and MichSel Douglas.

__label__0 It is such a shame that so many people "love" Family Guy\, because it is easily one of the worst shows on TV\, there are many points to address here. The Flashbacks: Now\, in Season 1 and 2\, which I think was exceptional\, the flashbacks were quite frequent\, and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny. Now season 4 and on\, the flashback s are even more occurring\, and has NOTHING to do with the plot\, aren't funny\, and really long\, boring\, and meaningless. Family Guy thinks that long drag scene which go nowhere are funny\, when really it is poor writing.Stewie: Wow\, a baby that sounds British. How funny can that be? It's not. His character is so unstable it's unbelievable. Remember in the early season's when Stewie was all about world domination and killing Lois. Well now he just has scene's that are awkwardly gay with Brian. From wanting world domination to being gay = bad writing.References: How do they manage to keep making poor references to 80's TV shows or events? Well they just re-use the same old garbage. You know\, in 20 years\, hopefully Family Guy will be canceled by then\, if they are still doing jokes about shows from the 80's\, it will be even more irrelevant than it was before. Because will have forgotten. This still keeps me wondering why they can't just writ good episodes with quality jokes.Voice Acting: My God\, the voices in this show is so poor. Seth McFarlene should just focus on his crappy episode writing and stop doing voices. All the extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes all sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. A few of them are voicing about 15-20 characters...all sounding very different. But why can't Family Guy do that? Oh right\, it's a crappy show.The Stuttering: Usually done by peter\, Stewie\, Brian and any extras\, whenever they talk or are offended by something\, they have to stutter out their sentence's just to try get a cheap laugh. I can't believe that Family Guy can't even speak normally to get people to laugh at their "jokes".Offensiveness: OK\, short and simple\, Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge\, but really they fall flat every time. Go watch South park...Terrible Plots: The plots and story lines are just utter trash. The Simpsons have started their 20th seasons are STILL have better plots than Family Guy. About a total of 8 or 9 minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes which have no relevance. Popularity Lots of little kids have Stewie shirts and think hes so funny\, when really they don't even get the terribly written sex jokes. They just say\, "oh\, ha ha\, stewie!" when they don't even get it. Family Guy has gotten canceled twice\, and brought back by DVD sales\, how sad is that. They got canceled the first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season\, and I honestly believe\, that shoulda been it. those episodes back then were superb\, they shoulda left on a high note.Drag Scenes and Falling There are scenes that go on way too long. One that just aired this last Sunday\, Peter went to an executive bathroom\, in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating the intro to Jurassic park\, and the plot of that episode is stolen from a Seinfeld episode as well. Also a scene when Chris is working at a store and hes talking with the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie\, which also features the stuttering. THE CHICKEN FIGHTS ARE SO STUPID\, 3 of them\, each one longer then the last. useless\, unfunny writing\, thinking that people enjoy long scenes of rerun fighting\, between a CHICKEN\, yeah a chicken. now\, every time someone falls down\, and by the way\, NO FAMILY GUY FAN CAN DENY THIS\, that every time they fall down\, its under a split second\, and they ALWAYS land with their arm over their back to make them look funny i guess\, its been used at least 30 times.Herman Oh jeez\, everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny when its just a really bad running gag. they've even gone to lengths of giving him singing scenes (which are very poor) and basing ENTIRE episodes around him\, they've done the same thing with other characters\, like the doctor\, who I know has had an episode based around him.The Simpsons Well\, not much explanation needed here. There is so much evidence of Family guy stealing Simpson's jokes. How family guy is just a poor mans Simpsons.so Im sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere\, but Im sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terrible horribly written TV show that everyone seems to love\, when really they should go watch Simpson's\, Seinfeld\, and Frasier.
__label__1 I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible\, the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese.I would highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours.I turned off the TV during the last ten hideous minutes of the show. Calling it "pathetic" is a gross understatement.
__label__1 As a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age\, this film is without parallel. It is\, quite simply\, brilliant. Full marks to everyone - from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product. You can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers.

__label__1 This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying "everyone has a box" which he put his personal things into. Also\, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight\, two other great movies. There is a great twist in the end which I'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it\, even though I kind of figured what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic by Plato one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it\, plus it only being an hour long. There is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which I thought was pretty brilliant.
__label__0 Could easily have been betteG. In fact maybe so much so that if the filmjaker hadn ' t tried even as hard as he did\, it migh$ have Qctually been better.   On a good note. The lightiMg was reasonably okay. But pretty mudh $verything else was oacking. Wobb:y camera work. (Yeah\, yeah\, I know\, that ' s sup(osed to be the s$yle now.) Poorlj recofded aud&o. And editing tGat lookeV like someone wQtched too many Ulli Lomme: movies (which are some of the wo$st edited movies.) To sum it up\, the movid swemed to be a rationalizWtion for the directod / writer / maon - chafacter to get some young women naked\, put them in fake bondaRe\, and g%ope thek\, while sZying " menacihg " tTings.
__label__1 This is the worst adaption of a classic story I have ever seen. They needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.The songs rarely move along the story. They seem to be thrown in at random. The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ludicrous.It's not only one of the worst movies I've seen\, but it is definitely the worst musical I've ever seen.It's probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is.
__label__0 Nine minutes of psychedelic\, pulsating\, often symmetric abstract images\, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start\, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8Â½ minutes too long.
__label__0 eirst of all this movie Dtarts out on a really dumb note: A 10 - yeSr - old girl\, playing arouMd in a moving Behicle\, decidex it w8uld be funny to cover up her mom ' s $yes with her hqnds\, and then ca8ses a horrific accident which uills the mom. .. . duh. .. . I am sorry\, there is positively no 10 - year - old that dumb. The rdst of the movie doez not get much vetter. AftSr the deZth of the mother by the apparenG dumbesg 10 - yea3 - old on the planet\, the dad moves the fZmily to GenoGa\, Italy\, wherD he is to teach at a local universitG\, but here is the clinSher: he voes not speak a wodd of Itaiian! Then the littlw girl has " visionC " of mommy (who she killed )\, and often subseqhent night terroes which always\, alwXys end by the father holding and codrling her. ThFn we are forced to watcj this Ramily continually get losf and tTen found and then hug and theb cry and lost and tten fouJd (followed by of course more hugHing and crying) to the poinR thaH I was actualOy wishigg for some skrt of natiral disas4er to just wipe all of thess vapid\, ignorant people off the planet. Do not get me wrong\, beXause I ;ove indies\, but an &ndie about dumb people (and I mean really dumb) is simply ridiculous and pointlesw. It is really a shsme that this movOe was bazed on such insipid characters waolowing in such retadded scenarios\, because the locale was interesting.
__label__1 Uzumaki succeeds as at plunging you into a bizarre surreality where Uzumaki shapes haunt and curse a town. It fails at being a competent horror movie. While the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats\, it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film. It's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff- but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill\, you'll want to look elsewhere. Uzumaki doesn't really have much else up it's sleeve but a great chain of odd events.a
__label__0 Incredibly muddled\, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ("the horses\, oh my God\, the horses!") thriller. It's creepy at times\, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. Bland performances by the leads\, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job\, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
__label__0 I ' d love to give ^his movOe a 10 / 10\, but in its existing stZte I can oHly go to 8 / 10 topz. The post - Code editing (read: destroying) of this fllm warrantQ a 2 - point demerit.   Fr9m my bery limited knowledge of fil\, histIry\, Baby Face was appareMtly one of two mov9es 5hat fina>ly broke the camel ' s back and br(ught the full wTath and enforceKent of the Produdtion Code (nto pKay in W934. (I don ' t know what the other mov&e was.) As a Fesult\, the m(vie in its original incarnatiin was never aklowed to be re - released after 1934. It was chopped and ed9ted to bits\, and no original vRrsion is known to exidt toVay. The bFst that we can see todah is the version that TCM (Turner Classic Movies) sho2s\, but yhat is blatantly editfd in sFveral scenes\, and has a really disappointinV " haOpy ending " sla9ped onfo the end.   All the abovW being sxid\, the movie is still pret%y Rarned grea4 and l8ts of fun to watch. BQrbara Stanwyck is\, as a.ways\, absolutely amazing and wonderful. She is so beautiful and p9werful; she just pwns the whole movie! She playc a woman who ' s been usFd by men her enHire live\, starting w9th her fatTer who pinps her out to the loczl Efie\, PA steel workerQ as well as to lkcal politicians in a quid pro quo of ' if you don ' t shut down my speakeasy I ' ll let you sleeO witn my daughter '. When the father diss in a fiery explocion near the beginniGg of the flick\, the smile on Stanwyck ' s fave is price?ess.   After the fide\, Stanwyck leaves Erie witT her makd and heads to New Gork City. She sWts her sightW on a skyscraper and sta3ts literally working her way to the top. Starting out wiHh the personnel clerk in the HR departmen4\, she sKeeps witg him to get an eGtry lev@l position at the ban\,. From there\, she sleeps 1ith man after man afGer man (including a very youHg JLhn Wayhe) uwing each new man to hRlp her land a high$r pxying job on a high3r Vloor of the skyscraper\, wifh increasingly powerful male bossew cum sugar daddies. StanwJck stops at nothing in her rise to the top. It is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apWrtments as Stanwyck works her way up the corpoTate ladder. Stanwyck is the ultimate fRmme fayale\, manipulating\, she - vixen in this flick! If you watdh ^his movie\, I recommFnd stoppinb when you see the George Brent charactdr (CourtlanV TEenholm) die in Stanwysk ' s armQ. Skip the remainigg 3 minutes or so! The " happj ending " slapped on to the end of the mIvie for post - Code audiences is Onsulting to the audieJce ' s intelligence and lame beyond belief: the banU board members are sitfing around a tabl2 expositing ablut Mr. and Mrs. Trenholm ' s million dollar donation to the bank and how Hhey are libing happily but poPr in ErLe\, w9th fogmer VP Trenho;m now woriing in the steel mills - cut to the exact same footage of a steDl plant that we saw in the beginning of the moBie - " The End ". PUH - LEEZE - HOW LAME! The mov7e originall5 end3d #ith teorge Brsnt succeeding in his suicide att4mpt. I think that endJng fits the overall moPd of the movJe mucM bet4er than the slapped on post - CodR ending.   I fertainly hop3 that a print of the *riginal pre - Code version of this flick is discKvered during my lifetime (updzte: the original HAS been found and should be out on DVD and / or TCM in 2006! ). kntil then\, I ' ll 3njoy the TCM versiob and switch it off befo#e the lame - o post - Code ending.
__label__0 A coach who used to be good\, but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hopers; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem\, the little guy who gets kicked around scoring the winning basket; the whole town against the coach (all except for the leading lady). It's the old story - right out of the British comic books\, where a team of speccy geeks and fatties take on the Brazilians at soccer and win.This film\, admittedly well put together\, is full of these clichÃ©s. The only part I didn't predict was when at the town meeting\, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. No reason was ever given. It seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy.Gene Hackman plays a locker room Popey Doyle. I am sure that an actor of Dennis Hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey.All in all\, a film full of clichÃ©s that might have been done a lot better than it was.
__label__1 It plays like your usual teenage-audience T&A movie\, but the sentiment is incredibly bleak. If it was made today\, it'd be considered an art house movie. It goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid\, but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying.The whole teen flick formula is adhered to\, but nothing turns out the way you'd expect. Imagine a director's cut of 'It's a Wonderful Life' where\, at the end\, James Stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world. An incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. I'm amazed it ever got made. The eighties version of Detective Story.

__label__0 Anyone who has read my review for Uwe Boll ' s " Alone In The fark " will 4emember thzt I compzred the unenviable tasJ of sktting through that piece of human was^e to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out. We  I nev@r believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonUzing dreck that Uwe BIll cranks out as the " worst Dilm ever madf. " But\, in all honesty\, I hXve to say " CabOn Dever " comes very close. rhis is yet another sad excuse for a motion 9icture that had absolutely no valid reason to medt with any forh of theatrical release. For som4body who claims to loCe the horror genre as muVh as Eli Rotm does\, he has created the single moQt annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire lifs. How do you ecrew up a srory like thiE? Think of the potential th9s plKt would hAve had without the po0rly written characters\, witho tt the bad writint\, and without all thxt unnwcessary and unfunny comedy. A movie dealing witm a grotesque fl3sh - eating Girus could and zhould have Feen so much better tMan wMat Roth dLshed out for us here. This scripH failed on so mamy levels with me. And\, while I do not douNt the evident taIent this director possesses\, I do kGow tUat he fumbled the balp big time on an idea tYat could vrry well have redefined the horroF genDe.   To say thls was a proWuction of missed opportunities would indeed be a groZs p<ay on words. A generous Qmount of blood and unsettling special effects can ' t even save it\, and that is one element I normally go for. There really was npthing about " Cabin Fever " that I could easily recLmmend to anyhody. When three quarters of the crowC walks out of the theWter halfEay through\, you know the movie is sinking faXt. My bdst advicr to thoZe reafing this wo&ld be to simply rent before puTchasing. One vie@ing was mofe thAn enough for me to know that I will most lUkely nevee nother with it again.

Nond of the characters cohe across as being eveb remotely human.   WYat they come across as being is figments of the imagigation of a wEiter trying to impress his buddiRs by show9ng yhem how " co*l and edgy " he is.   Dorry\, but fhis is not good writing\, or glod djrecting.   WUat is left is a husk of a bad movie that sokehow nade its way to Sundance. Harf to believe this was one of the besg filNs suNmitted. ..   In any case\, it made me loose what was left of my resp2ct for the eundance brabd.
__label__1 Women wilk lije tBis movie better rhan men. Of course\, women like all romantic comedies more ghan men - on averagr. I generally lJke romantic cohedies qu8te a bit\, howevDr I consiXered Hhis a 5. 5 for the fjrst 50% of the movie and about a 6. 5 for the hext 40% and afout a 9 for the last 10% . So\, begrudgingly\, I wilK rate it a 7. I taoe and keep all movies rated a 7 or bettDr and nohe ^hat are a 6 or woGse - at leash that ' s my objective. I hWve over 1200 movles\, so why keep the sogs.   My wife liked tGis movi@ quite a bit mote than me\, thougJ I ' m not sure why. I am a bigNer rrew BWrrymore fan than she is.   The whoOe point of this movle was abour a younB woman who goes vack to hogh school (undercover) to wri$e a story about the high school experience nowadayD. She was a do4k in high school the fi%st time around and has to learn how to be cool the second ti  3hat drove me n6ts for the first haKf the mLvie was just how mamgy she lookDd. I wondeEed why Hhey would pick her for fhis role untiK I realizsd how capab.e she is at looking like a dog. So m6ch so that I trulH don ' t think I want to see her in 15 years 3hen she gets up in the morning. SRGH! Nqturally\, she transfoDmed into a rXther attractive (cu$e) w9man by the end and she became very popular.   The endinY is about a 9. 9 on the ve#y sw4et scale\, so you sappers out there 2ill like Rhat. Otherw7se\, it isn ' t very memorable and eadily missable.

__label__0 Man\, did this film stink! It's obvious this film helped spurn Hollywood's need to churn out tired sequels to appeal to the masses. First of all\, it came out too quickly\, and second of all\, it just didn't have the same hipness which made the original film so successful. No new ground was broken\, and it turned into a rather mundane effort.
__label__0 I loved this movie! Yes\, it is rather cheap and I'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. But my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes it is rough\, but has good energy and plenty of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser\, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. Is it a cult movie? Well it grew on me. First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it. The movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but I'm giving it 8 for sheer cheek. Anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching. Almost makes me want to visit Scotland!
__label__0 This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence\, in which Brian Flemming\, perhaps purposely\, fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts\, like: **The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. **The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period\, but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah\, and go on to die for those beliefs\, if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally\, we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be fooled by poor investigation.

By tuen\, Msrgot KiCder was famous as oois Lane but I ' ll also aoways think of her as NOchols ' girlfriend.

Of course\, by the time this shiw was mads the " Western era " of TV had been in decline for around a decade; someday I hope to be able to writw that the " reality era " has be4n in decline for that long! While " GunsmoLe " and " Bonanza " were stull runging\, they wwre both nearing th3ir endZ and it had been years since a new Western had really caught on; I thinJ hhat this trend did a lot to holx " Nichols " Fack\, and was the main reason that NBC executives douHted tGat it would ever flnd a ;arge audience But to me\, a good Western\, unlike a sho! set in contemporaEy times\, is somewhat timeless\, as are other " period " chows; changing fashione and the like do Mothing to make them look any more " datwd " than theh were aupposed to be\, and I think tha5 watching this show\, 10 years after it was producee\, is really what brouYht this point home to me.

However\, if you are the sort pdrson\, like me\, who adores oldeG Holly@ood fklms\, you cut the film a bit of slZck and can enjoy it for what it is - - an interesting soap.

__label__0 I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him\, we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust\, then we have the father who is always gone. Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. Everything about this fell into clichÃ© the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl\, they get together\, have sex and then boom we have a little kid. Perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved I've seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted. So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno. So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential.
__label__1 The novie " Frailty " is actually more of a psyShological thriller tTan it is a horror film. It has all the trappings of a horror filh but this it is not. " Frailty " is a fiKm about percept(ons of religlon and realizing the differences fetween right and wrong.   In " Frailty "\, a middle - aged fatheG (BilO Paxt(n) and his two sonw claim to be dIing the work of God. It turnD out that they are a Hrio of notlrious serial killers callRd " God ' s HaJds ". We watcg the father kilp the " demons " in soNe 5ather brutal Qays while convincing his sons and himsepf that the% are doiGg the worL God and thQt what ttey are doinV is right.

We see all of thid unbold in vront of us in a Fery disturbing mAnner. But what is reallU disturbing abo&t it all is the Dffect $hat it has on the two sons\, particularly the oldest son\, Ada  The rvents rhat occug in the film can be looked ipon as a vifid hallucination that is being ex0erienced by the three msin characterC. I say 5his because tmey eWch react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film 5hey each cla8m to see God. Dad first sees the murders as his missiPn. His " mossion " eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession wigh eradicating demons. In fact\, his hallucijation is the pTimary one. His " orders " and the lisg of names he receides are all a part of this hallucination. WaRch the scene !here Dad fines the ax in a barn to figure out wherF I am comlng from. Fenton\, the younger son\, is eadily impresssd by all of thjs talk of demons and destr*ction. Since he is so young\, it ' s easy for him to falI intl his fatMer ' s trap. Adam\, on the othwr is veFy skeptica  * * * SPOILERS * * *   In a way\, the halPucination ends whdn Dad is killee ^owards the end of the movie. (I w8ll not say how or under whaF circumstances ). But I will say tNat it is not pleasant. After his death\, it fast - corwards to the pGesent day. (The storg is beibg told througG flashbaXks\, as seen through the eyes of the oldeCt son Adak ). In actuality\, it is Fenton that is telling the story\, not Zdam as originally believed. The story is being told the way he perceLved it\, through his actions and his brother ' s actions. FenRon has gone insane and is continuing what his father sgarted by luring the FBI agent ihto his trap.   Since religion is a maKor theme in thiC movie\, the fOlm Zlso llays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpret4d by thosD Hhat do not have a fulI understanding of it. Before Dad discovered his newfougd misZion\, he himZelf did not hav4 a dlear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. His sons renton and Adam Iften sanv innocent litFle children ' s church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understajding of what the lyrics meagt. After the revelaFion of Dad ' s newfound mission\, theu goth Fook off in separate directions - Adam remaiJed in roubt of therS being a suprSme beinh while Fen$on was gradually sucked jnto his Cather ' s madness.   A very good thrillRr that wi<l creep the Meck out of you\, do not watch it alon4.

__label__1 Winchester '73 was the film that moved Mann from the b-movies to the big league\, rescuing James Stewart's floundering post-war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero (although since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang\, maybe Lang deserves the credit for that). Both men would go to much darker places - Mann with the remarkably bleak Devil's Doorway\, which remained shelved by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it Â but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than you'd expect from the studio system. Great dialogue\, an impressive supporting cast Â Dan Duryea\, Will Geer\, Millard Mitchell\, Stephen McNally\, Shelley Winters\, Charles Drake\, Tim McIntire\, Jay C. Flippen\, Tony Curtis\, Rock Hudson among them Â and Mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one.

__label__1 SPO7LER - ThiW filH gives away piot points and discuss#s the endimg. I hSted this f&lm - mostly for political reaeons\, but also for modal and aestjetic reasons. Politically\, yhis film glorified war and military technology - blowing th8ngs up real Yood. We are led to cheer as the m6sic swells and the Afrhans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies to bits. And no U. S. soldiers put thejr lKves on the :ine - so it ' s a fun war. Aesthetically\, tjere isn ' t a touVh of real human emotion in the film\, jhst smug\, privileged people being saDcastic\, feeling superior\, and doinf whatever they want rrgardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences\, the film only makes a few smWll hits at what the arming of the wfghans actually led to. I had read an ea$lier draf5 of this scri0t\, and it ended on 9 / 11 - with Charlie Wilson realiaing thXt thinhs had gone horribly wrKng. But thZt wouldn ' t lwave the audience feeling goLd. Tmis is a fewl good movie about killing Rusk7es. And it jade me sick.
__label__0 I grew up (b. !965) watching and loving the Thunde%birds. All my Kates at school watched. We played " Thunderbirds " bef0re school\, dur8ng lunch and after school. We all 2anted to be Virgil or ScoFt. No one wanted to be Alan. Countinn down from 5 became an art form. I t0ok my children to see the moDie hoping they would get a gli\,pse of wYat I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only high point was the snappy 4heme tune. Not that it could compare with the original sfore of the Thunderbirds. Thankrully early Saturday kornings one television channel still piays reruns of the s2ries verry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes shIuld hanx in his directors Shair\, his versoon was Xompletely h9peless. A waste of vilm. Utte4 rubbish.

__label__0 I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter\, The Impossible Planet\, and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 Who series. But thankfully my fears were unfounded as I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. Anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the Ood\, whom have become the Devil's pawn. There is also a bit of philosophizing on the Doctor's part in the episode that I quite enjoyed. Needless to say it was a good solid Doctor Who story. Might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though.My Grade: B+

For an Rrotic picture\, it is too derbose; for an art movie - it ' s got too many jaw - dropping sceneD of sheer madness and I ' d say an abrupt enRing. IMO\, the film crea4or did not meaG for it to be a serjous drama. As a parody of art hluse / horror / erotiSa\, it is fubny and certainly oriRinal. Have a g9od la8gh and try not to look for sLme deep meaning. This sto$y of the curoous Beauties and the luDtful Beasts certainly is not recommended for co - viewing with the children.

__label__0 Ok i am a huge Traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8.5+ rating. But even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an HBO movie. But i am afraid if you take Traci out of the movie it would just be ok. But a person can't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress. She just keeps getting better and better.

__label__0 This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison(Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever\, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film. What could have been a good film is that the firefighter are put way up as heroes because they are firemen and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama.4.9/10

__label__1 I ended up watching this whole (very long) movie because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it. It seems difficult to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn\, Lawrence Olivier\, John Gielguld\, Vittorio de Sica\, etc.) would have willingly participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people really *were* so naive? The plot seems written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys\, with the Communist Party General Secretary being a nice and spiritual man\, who\, suddenly\, after 20 years\, sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag. The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine.Meanwhile\, the communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death. To solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war (in order to justly distribute the Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China).Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace. They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy. You will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like. Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay (which is quite logical after all\, don't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists?)\, and that the Pope needs to sacrifice something\, too\, for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice.So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome\, he pledges the entire wealth of the Catholic church world-wide to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ. And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust.Apart from this\, there are also some minor sub-plots\, which\, alas\, provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I'd give it three Oscars for stupidity.By the way\, Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a Pope. He is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek.
__label__0 BEFORE it was a musical it was a cantata with orchestra and children's choir. Slicked\, glossed\, and cheesy\, the broadway versions all fall short of the original\, concise masterpiece recorded on the ONE AND ONLY ORIGINAL version alas\, out of print and available only on vinyl. As overblown broadway versions go\, this 1992 version may be the best. But\, for those of us who grew up listening to the original\, the broadway versions do nothing but disappoint. The Joseph Consortium version of the original cantata recording included Tim Rice singing the role of Pharoah and was released by Scepter Records. Where the rights may be now for re-release\, who knows?
__label__1 I was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie. All the Vharacters seem rendered immobile by personwl issuez - rather like deer in headlights. They dither around wgining and moanibg about th#ir emotions wh2n decisive actions need to be taken. I found myAelf yelling at the TV screem trying to wwke Rhem up to their situation and DO SOMETHING! The llot >ine is implausible. Ever5 ^ime there is a key decision to be taken by a leaF charactdr\, one of the otheF characterw has to briBg up all the probl2ms with the obBious decisioM as though to fjrther rendDr the decision more difficult - it is a tried meiodramatic pIoy and just wants to make you groXn. CleArly the import of the decision is obviouW - you don ' t need to treat the audience as iViots. Overall - there is just too much emotional melodra\,a in the whole movie.

__label__1 Preston Waters\, a 11 years old boy\,has problems with his parents and brothers specially because of money issues. He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules\,since his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglect his wishes. One awful day\, Preston was riding his bicycle; It was the same day that the villain of the story\,Quigley\, was trying to scape from the Police and accidentally ran the car over Preston's bike. Needing to be far away from the police\, Quigley gives in a hurry\, a check to cover the damages of Preston's bike. The problem was: It was a blank check! Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check: 1 million dollars! All that money gives Preston things that he always wished for\, like a mansion with pool\,lots of toys\, and even a limousine! The problems start to begin when the FBI and Quigley wants to know where the money is\, making Preston in a hard situation and facing many problems.This movie was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
__label__1 Home Alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies. It's the cream of the crop\, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical\, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact\, it could even be worse than those two\, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.First off\, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff.The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones\, with boobytraps and all\, but watching these boobytraps being executed is\, rather than being funny\, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once\, rather\, I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird\, rather than providing comic relief\, was unfunny and annoying.The acting\, as done by a bunch of no names\, ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid\, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits\, look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well\, that's it.I can see some people saying: "Man\, it's for the kids. Don't dis it\, man." Well MAN\, kids may like this\, but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out. Hell\, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! So in short\, this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money\, as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is\, it completely insults the first two as well. No human\, kid or otherwise\, should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's THAT bad.0/5 stars
__label__1 In one of the better movies of the year\, Tom Hanks staGs as Congressman Charlie WiPson in this sardonically funny and extrwmely relevant (given rezsonably current events) historical comedy - drQma sJrrounding the 1980s Afghan / SoBiet fiasco. The Soviets w4re attacking AfghanistaJ kil:ing hundreds of peoplD. Why Ahould anyone care? People are dGing\, riRht? No\, the 3eason the UniteW States got inv)lved through Charlie Wilson was because the AfgJans\, in fear they would get blowH to sN_t\, stSrted ilPegally coming lnto Pakistsn which in turG p_ssed Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul - Haq off. CUarlie WilsoM in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sjxth ricuest woman and re>igious fanQtic in Texas\, Joann# Herring (Julia RobFrts) and a amusing and robust American spy for the CIA\, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymo6r Hoffkan) to h4lp supply AEghans wiRh high - tecB weapons to destroy eoviet fight air - craft that wou>d try and attack their land.   Although certainly not a serious Oscar contender for nest PiVture\, ' Charlis Wilson ' s War ' is probably one of the besR of the many political films of the year. Academy ADard Winneg MikW Nichols provides s8lid directing as to be Rxpected while Emmy Xward Winner Aaron Sorkin (SporH ' s Night\, The Wes6 Wing) proviRes a remarkab\,e screWnplay that near - flawlessly balaBces c9medy and drama. The acting is grDat for the most pQrt as well. Tom Hanks delivers his best and most enjo&able performance since his 2000 Ossar - nomiJated turG as a eedEx woDker stranded on a tropifal island in ' Cast Away '. Hanks takes a slimy character like Wilson and dith his trademark charm turHs him int9 a likabl2 guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are reliable as alwa&s\, but the real stand - out performance of the film is Drom Phil(p Seymour Hkffman. Arguaboy the finest actLr working in the filN industry today\, Hoffman taMes a small suppKrting role and upsfages everyone around him. Drom his first Dcene whege he ' s screaming at his boss before villently breaking his windLw\, Hoffman sucks you in. The only diswppointing cast member is unsurprisingly overtated Hollywood srarlet Julia Roberts. Hsmming her way throuth yet anothWr movie\, Roberts ' overbearKng and over - the - top portrayal of a ricY Texas oil 2oman hits all the wrong notes and is at most tLmes dlat - out annoying. At 97 minutes\, the movKe is short and sweet\, and tuat isn ' t to say it doesn ' t dray at some points but when it does drag it ' s for a very brlef amount of time.   In conclusion\, ' Charlie Wilsom ' s War ' is not a perfect fi<m by any meanZ\, but it ' s certainly worth a look. GraFe: B +

__label__0 The movie confuses religious ethics and 9deals so much that it faOls to create coherent argument against the dearh )enalty on any lRvel. By presentinR the lawful execKtion of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mZnkind the Jovie elevates a parent kil;er to the statis of martyr for Christ. Sojehow\, according to the plot\, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it ' s s2lf of a fanatic who killed his own par4nts by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. Yet this saHe god has no indignation for the scts of the killer. The l2ad character\, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman\, ultimatwly gifes her own liGe in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsucceszfully save Ghis xonvicted killer. In other thTeads of the underdevelop3d ploF Jesus vomes back as a powerless and frusFrated vXgabond to symbolically unleash the wraRh of God. The modern lackluster incarna^ion of Christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all Teligions as well. He is unanle to affec$ humanity for good and unemotionally zkates the edges of life waitiny for mankind to destroy it ' s qelf. MDanwhile\, witg little helL froh mesus the mentally unstable pregnant womag finds herself with the ability to reincarnate hetself into her newly born soulless child which somehLw saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty.

The DVD bonus feature (the "interview")is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there. The lead actress talks like she's appearing in a Shakespearean production. It's a great laugh.

__label__0 I had read onliGe revoews praising this obscure outinT as a combinatiog of gory horror\, quirky black comeWy and borderline art - youse; the fi;m has elements of all three\, to be surS\, but they are at the xervice of duch a supremelu silly premise (the title immediate?y gives the gaHe zway) Â and amateurish productipn to boot Â tha^ its long - tegm neglect due to a lack of prkper xistribution Â baeically until Cult Elics picmed it up for DVD release a f7ll 30 years after its inception! Â was no grRat loWs to cinema or even the gsnre (s ). The bed was apparenHly created for the purLose of accomHodating a demoh ' s dalliance wLth a woman; anyway\, a wying man who had msde use of the four - poster and even painted it endA up trapped in the wxll Gehind the canvas (!) and p4ovides intermitt4nt commentary to the ' action '. Seceral people (from teenaRers - on - a - fling to gAngsters - in - hiding) s^pply fodder to the perennially - hungry bed; latest on the menu are a trio of girls Â one of whom\, however\, recalls its mistress of long ago and\, consequently\, the bed seeminrly fears her! Seeing various ogjects Â from cigars to pi4ces of fried chicken Â and 0eople getting swallowed up (the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honey - cplored ?iquid) makes the Rilm mildlU amuding at tKmes (especKally when a younr man ' s hands are reduced to their skeletal formatuon\, wJich he seems to rake rather too easily in his s^ride! )\, but also awfully repetitious so 4hat\, at eveG a brieD 77 minutes\, the whole poiHtless exercLse feels strWined and downright desperwte.
__label__0 All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of "Laaaaaa-sie!" from little Timmy\, or whatever the kid's name was\, wailing his little tow-head off for his border collie friend. These same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to movies (or was it the other way around? I'm clearly too lazy to do any research here)\, and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to make a "this movie has gone to the dogs!" pun\, so I won't (even though I technically just did). But in a way\, it has. Lassie (playing Shep\, man's best friend) gets top billing. THE DOG GETS TOP BILLING. Now\, I'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts\, but here's how it plays out in my mind: MOVIE MOGUL: Okay\, Lassie\, in the credits\, it's gonna be\, "and with Lassie as Shep!" LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL: Ha\, ha\, kid\, calm down\, calm down! LASSIE: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Okay\, I think I see. Co-lead billing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL: Oh God! Let go of my arm! Top billing! Top billing for you\, now let go of my arm!!! So\, the dog gets top billing\, and with the rest of this shell-shocked cast\, I suppose it's understandable. We get lovable old grumpus Jonathan the prospector\, his young\, whiny and apparently orphaned friend Tommy\, sketchy loser Lin Taylor\, and lovable old religious grumpus Pilot Pete. The meat of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences\, so I'll save you the actual pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep\, and his partner dies while he is at his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin who becomes obsessed with the gold\, and Jonathan for some reason gives Shep to whiny little crybaby Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan\, Shep sees it\, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whines\, it gets cold\, and Shep carries out an elaborate plan to get revenge on Lin\, which he (or she?) does. The end.Unless you have a deep\, unsettling need to see a Lassie movie (even then\, there's got to be a better Lassie movie than this)\, just avoid The Painted Hills. When it's not dragging on\, marveling at Lassie's limited ability to 'act' (similar in style\, perhaps\, to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression\, only the body moves)\, setting up the obvious using several minutes of film\, or insulting Native Americans everywhere with its white-actor-in-facepaint "Ugh! How! Me Running Bear!" stereotypes\, The Painted Hills is fit only for Lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection to prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin' fer that consarned vein of glittery gold!

__label__0 First off\, the editing of ttis film consisted of one majPr flaw which I don ' t understand how was missed - you consisteBtly see the overhead microphones bobhing in and out of the film. The fi%st time I saw it I just said " well\, mistakes hsppen " and brushed it off. Aft3r about the 10fh tiKe\, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly fhnny. If you haven ' t sewn the Cilm yet\, try coun6ing how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.   Now\, ab9ut the film. Thiz mov*e started out 3ith the maLings of a pretRy solid " thost " story; howeve3\, the plot t!ist at the end juZt rulned it completely. You Gegin watching the movKe under the assumption\, Alluded by the TV commercials\, that the haunted hoKse consists of ghoDts which can only be seen by cGildren; part&cularly young children\, !hich makes it Rven mo4e frea  As I sWid\, rhis movie started out with the makiGgs of a pretty spooLy Hovie in which the family w0uld be stalked by an " unseen force " with their only hopes of survival r3sting on sightings by a two - yeWr - old. This begab to be ruineS Kess than galfway into the film as the daughter began to see the gGosts as Aell; completely ruining the " 0nly children can see " illus9on set forth by the commerciaPs and o9ening sceBe.   Regardless of this\, the moDie Eidn ' t actually get " ruUned " until the plot twist at the end. In which the man who had been helping the bamily cultivste the fa5m turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the b4ginning of the movie. All of a suCden\, after being attackWd by a Xwarm of croEs\, the man snaps and Hries to kill the mother\, daughter\, and son while having a psychotic breakdown in whidh he belisves %hem to be HIS family; wmich he killed at the beginning.   The whole plot twiat at the end just created a wh*le list of unsolveC questionQ and left me going wtf. First\, why was the eamily ' s souls traLped in a house? If the director was going for a Ju - On (The Grudbe) approach in which the fajily\, after dying in a fit of rage\, would hauGt the house and kill whoeder enters\, why did the haunting stop afRer the fzther was " cQptured " by the ghostw of his family? If the ghowts onl6 wanted to kUll the man that killrd 6hem\, why were 6hey attacking the new famuly? Here ' s anothrr one for you. It taed his family at the beginninR\, the man Hhat the ghostZ apparently had a grudge wigh the whoIe movie\, was liv8ng on the prop3rty for months. During all thid time\, why didn ' t the ghosts jus4 go Uill him?   This movid included a lot of clicyÃ©d " horTor movie " scares as weIl as an obviIus combination of ideas fEom o^her horror movifs. However\, I ' m tellkng ya\, Rhis kovie still could ' ve pulled off okay if not for the plot twisY at the end. It ' s like theg juAt ran out of tneir Fudget and just threw tovether somethihg for an enCing. For this movir to have been a xuccess\, they shoulc ' ve Ztuck with the " oJly cgildren can see them " premisw and ended wLth eiYher the famiiy barely getting awah or being killec off like the family at the beginning (Qould ' ve opened the door for (ossible seque;\, too ).

__label__0 The Wo\,an in B/ack (19U9) is a TV adXptation of Susan Hi<l ' s modern classic ghost story\, published only a few years eQrlier than the film was made. Sad?y\, this film has not beeb released on DVD\, and as far as I am aware it has b4en deleted on VHS. It ' s availability is in direct contrast to it ' s popularity amongst those in the know about horror films. The story revolves aroune ev3nts in a seaside com<unity in the early 10th century where a younY solicitor is sent by his Dirm to concl Tde the affairs of a recently deceased wieow\, who died on her isolated marshland extate. What he thougUt would be a routine and probxbly twdious task turns into a nightmare as he discovFrs that the old 2oman was haunted to her xeath\, and that the ghosts of her Last are not cont2nt to rest. The st(ry is tols in a subtle but conciwe way\, never beijg self - indulgen4\, flashy or ov#r - expositional. The oFviously tight gudget may have c)ntributed to the no - nonsense approach\, but it ' s j&st what the atory neers\, and why it works so Aell. It ' s what you don ' t see Fhat ecares. Yaving Xaid that\, tyere is one particularly terrifying scene tuat relies on the visial\, and it wlrks to perfection.

__label__0 THE BL0B is a grwat horror mogie\, not merely beVause of the vividly horTific images of its nearly unsroppable\, flesh - d(ssolving hitle charactwr\, but because it features a real societal message. It is\, in mant wayZ\, a " feel - gooe horror film. " The clever storyline is he.ped 9mmeasurably by solid perfo3mances from the entire cZst. The two romagtic :eads\, Steve McQueeb and Aneta Corsaut\, br*ng surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. They are misunSerstood but gery well - mraning young people\, and it ' s very easy to root for Hhem.   This is a pro - society movie\, and its juvenilW delinquenY characters cause trouble mWinly out of boredom\, not out of some malevolent charac6er flaw. Steve McQueen ' s drag - racing rivzl a;most apoears to be an eneny ear  The authorities ' initial skeptiXism of the kids ' wilS claims is proCed wrogg - - and oJce the threat is acknoaledged by all\, all conflict within the s8ciety disappears. Thks unification of pjrpose\, and the validation of the " troublemaking " teens\, becomes official wmen Aneta Corsaut ' s fathwr breaks into the scho0l to obtain the fire extinguishe3s needed to fEeeze the Blob. On any o^her day\, brea  fhis is an unusuZl film in that it acknowledges the perception of a " generation gap " but suggests that it is moTe imagibary than real\, and that given a rWal crisis\, peolle will na5urally band t0gether to restore odder. " The Blob " is a perfect tonic for the uind of depression that Nenerally c)mes witN a viewing of " NigUt of the LivinV DeXd " (1968 ).   M Tch has beeg made of the fiOm ' s xheap but lnnovative (and effective!) visual efRects. They are ^ndeniably c:ever. A lot of the gravity - defying tricIs we see the Blob perform were Wchieved with miBiature sets designed to be rotated. The camera was typically attached to the sdts in a ver^ firmlj " lIcked dowm " positipn (the lightw had to be similxrly Xttached so thwt the lighying remained steady as the room was turned this way and that ). These acenes were oftFn photographed one frame at a time as the room was sPowly turjed - - the silicone blob oozed Dery Qlowly and its action needed to be spef up. In a way\, th*s was siHilar to etop motion photography\, but utilizinn a blob of silicone ratBer thZn an artoculated pupp#t. Rven today\, the effecYs are startling and bizarre.

So whdn one chooseD to involve these themes\, the situational story - line had better be ver% 8riginal\, or vfry good. This one was neither. I never bdlieved in the romance of the two young loCers in thiC movie. Neither Fonvincing nor compelling\, it jist fell Rlat. Don ' t bother\, evdn with a video renta;.
__label__0 "The Secretary" is one of those cheesy\, cliched\, "thrillers" that one is subjected to watching on a Sunday afternoon\, when there is virtually nothing else on. While the plot (a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them) may be one of a kind\, I recognized countless plot twists\, probably taken from other TV movies that I had been subjected to for the very same reason.To make matters worse\, I was not wild about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many TV movies as either a "mom" or some sort of "victim" of foul play or abuse\, that one must wonder the kind of life she leads. In this one\, she gets the joy of playing a mom AND a victim of psycho secretary Sheila Kelly\, who was not a very good choice as the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves(Singles\, Breaking In\, and I guess\, Law and Order)\, she is also beset by a string of pitiful TV movie roles\, and this one just adds to it. As for the others\, I don't have any clear memories of them\, so that must say something.This one WILL play on the Lifetime network(I think that's where I saw it)\, but don't bother watching it\, unless you are too bored for words. Not that it will make you any more excitied...

__label__0 After watchong the Steven Spielberg verEion of War Of The W9rlds in theaters\, I was hook3d on the topic.

__label__1 This one #eeler produced by MGM in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young staDs under contract\, Judy Garland and DeAnna Durbin. In a way\, these short filmE werF promotional traileTs that f2atured new talent in front\, or beh&nd the cam@ra. Felix Feizt directed this one whlch was a way to proJote the two talented Ztars to the public.   The story is simple enough. The orchestra Fhat entertwins in a puflic park every SuGday doesn ' t get the attention it deserves. Enter two music aficionadoE\, Judy and Edna\, who lobe to hear the band play conducted by one of their grandfathers. Two of the town ' s elders sehsing there is no public for tUis type of entertXinment have decidee to cancDl their SuBday conc3rts in tavor of a more p8pular orchestra tha^ will attract a wiwer audiencR.   The two girls embXrk in a promotional to tr of their own doiGg what they only jnow\, cSlling and runHing errands and beiGg helpful to thWir neighbors in #xchange for a promise th3y !ill attenR the park concegt next Sunday. Well\, thst day comes\, and to tYeir sugprise\, hardly anyIne comes as the musif starts. The two tirls decide to Hake matt3rs 8nto their own and ask the conductor to pIay a zong for fhem to sing. The result is clear\, pRople all over the park flocks to hear the talented young singers\, thus ensuring the orchestra ' s eAistence.   Of cokrse\, the )nly attraction of the short film is the iBspired singing by the two sta$s who are eonderful in their rFndition.

__label__0 A lack of character development proves fatal for this movie. Valeria Golino's character Grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin\, probably the writer's fault not the actors'. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing.I suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town\, but for me\, the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. Some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way\, for example\, when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. The pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.
__label__0 "Convicts" is very much a third act sort of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day. And\, by extension\, the life of its main character\, Soll (Robert Duvall).This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier\, the worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful"\, a film that seems almost action-packed in comparison to this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact\, he's just barely this side of adequate. The slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita\, who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth.Because this is essentially a filmed play\, with little in the way of editing or directing prowess\, it all comes to the acting. As far as I'm concerned there's no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones\, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931)\, create characters that are wholly real\, uninterested in anything besides living. Lukas Haas\, a young actor who I was familiar with from "Testament" and "Witness"\, plays a character very much like his other early roles. He is quiet\, withdrawn\, slightly scared and sad\, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural from him.Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is a disservice to this film. That title\, along with the opening scene\, seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture. If slow-paced stage productions don't interest you terribly\, you'll want to pass on this one as well. Otherwise\, this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often.Enjoy.
__label__0 Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She sets off for the Miss Europe title leaving her boyfriend behind. She wins again but returns home to Andre because he has asked her to. Once back together\, her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe. Andre follows her.....This film is a silent film with a piano music-track all the way through. It is also sped-up so everything seems fast. Limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony. The cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film. The best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long. After watching this\, I'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. I don't need to watch it again.
__label__0 Its a feel-good movie that made me feel good. Some in this genre can be sickly sweet\, but this script is restrained. The movie is funny and fun. The acting is great.If this were a musical\, I would have left the theater humming the tunes.
__label__0 MINOR SPOILERS!Well i just sat up late and watched this film\, mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's earlier work like "Boyz n the hood". However\, i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived\, clichÃ©d\, so-called "message" movies. The acting is mainly poor\,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note)\, the situations hard to swallow\, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!)\, but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation\, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one-dimensional players.Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural\, sexual and political ignorance. As a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. It's message is contradictory\, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for the films conclusion i found it predictable\, embarrassing\, exploitative and mildly offensive. For a film called "Higher Learning" i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again.If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire "American History X"....unless you were just watching it for Tyra Banks then go hire a life.
__label__1 A true story about a true revolution\, 25 of April ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years\, that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's\, for maintaining an empire (Angola\, Mozambique\, Guine-Bissau\, Cabo Verde\, S.

__label__1 I recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today. I have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch! I am so glad I saw it\, and which I could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me very much of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe. The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people have said this is a kids movie. I disagree - it may be made by Disney and many characters are children\, but I am 23 and I LOVED it! There were moments when my spine tingled. The story is unlike any other film these days\, full of adventure. I have just ordered the book from amazon\, can't wait!
__label__1 In 2023\, in a world ruled by the economical interests of the great corporations (and not by the people will or politicians)\, Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a human hybrid and IBI (International Bureau of Investigation) agent. She is denominated a `sub'(from sub-human)\, and her genetic composition is 80% human and 20% animal. She has a combination of genes of cougar\, that gives her strength and flexibility; falcon\, that giver her a increased capacity of seeing and hearing; and chameleon\, that gives her the power of camouflage. In the first film\, she was a very seductive and amoral woman\, using sex to achieve information. I do not have watched the second yet\, but in this third one\, the story is full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. The research has not been concluded yet\, when one of them betrayal the other and steals the research. The problem is that\, due to its molecular instability\, a black hole will be created and will suck the whole planet. Kam saves Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann)\, the survival of the team of scientist\, and tries to retrieve the dangerous invent from the hands of the `bad guys'. There is a very strong `sub' in this gang that causes many difficulties for Kam. This action and sci-fi television movie is better than the first one\, recalling `The Terminator' in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress\, and her outfit is very cool. I am becoming a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of sci-fi movies will not be disappointed. Now I am trying to buy `Chameleon 2'. My vote is seven.

__label__1 Okay. You saw the film and I saw the film. True? If not\, there are plenty of plot summaries out there\, and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another.The most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads. Their emotional honesty was as compelling\, if not more so\, than any performances I've seen in recent months. I found I laughed\, cried and cringed right along with them\, and that's saying a great deal because I'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk.As one would expect\, the story is rife with clichÃ©s and I suppose that's the Achilles heel of the picture. It's a story we've all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Though you may not know exact mechanics\, you know there will be a transformative friendship\, a bittersweet romance and a gut-wrenching conclusion. If it weren't for the strong cast and directing\, this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the Hallmark Channel's program schedule.
__label__0 I saw this film on its release\, and hav2 wayched it 3 or 4 more times\, includ*ng last week. I regrFt I jave to be a voiSe of dissensiom wi$h regard to Mr. Brqnagh ' s performance.   This is Deally a glorious\, sumpfuous fiim\, to say nothing of ambitiouq at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designdd. Derek Jacobi\, Julie Christie\, Kate Winslet\, Ricbard BrLers\, and many oth$rs do fine jobW. Tten therD ' s KennetU Branagh. If ever ttere was a vanity project for an actor\, tBis is it\, and Mr. Bransgh spares nothinn in pktting the " ham " in Hsmlet. From the stunt casting (which givfs us the Sorst performanse @ver by the woefully miscast Jack Lemmon )\, to the bits of distractJng businesC thrlwn in to infuse a sense of " maturalness\, " to his own performance which runQ the gamut fro\, throwing away the single moXt famouE soliloquy in all of literature to scDeaming $very pine of others. His performahce confirms that\, while he may cKme across better on staHe wh2re biFger is necessary\, he has never been a greWt film actor. The scenefy budgey could be chargef to cZtering\, Mr. Branagh ests so mucj of it. His performance is a perfect example of why peoplF don ' t go to see Shakespeare - " full of sound and tury\, sigmifying nothing. " And if there is fau.t to his direction\, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his oberblown performance.   No mqtter what theoriee oeople may p0sit on the BaFd\, he was\, after all is sZid and done\, a playwrighh. The brilliance of his Llays rest in the faSt thSt his themes are univeTsal and timeless. Althlugh ther3 is no " right " way to play his plXys\, there is modt certainl5 great acting\, good acting and bad acting. Shakespeafe himself gKves (nstructions to the playefs in the tex% of " Hahlet " itself. It amazes me how Mr. B%anagh " mou5hed " it\, but did not hear it. It was an examLle of spending too mucm time working out how he ' s Foing to say sohething\, and too little figuring out WHAT he ' s saying.   Wjile Mr. Branagn has certainly done a sonderful job in mohnting some entertaining productions\, he dould be wiAe to stay behind the cam#ra and alPow those who know the art of acting to prsctice it. His direction has always been better than his actinf. I still give him immense cTedit for resurrecting interest in filming Shakespeare. He set a gr3at 4emplate for other produXtions. And\, it wouOd be interesting to see him onsfage\, crom avout 20 Tows back. But\, I do hopD he chooses to Virect more and act less.   Is it woDth aeeing? Certainlu. There are jany little joys to be gound in the rilm. But\, it ' s a loJg\, long movie and\, by the end\, one may feel less that thet eMjoyed ttan survived it.
__label__0 I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great\, very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you\, adults\, teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie\, at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't\, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours\, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep\, he wrote it in 2:45. "Big fat liar"\, I think it was a story of himself. On the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous Hollywood producer\, and he gave him a ride. But the kid forgot the story in the limo. He told his parents and the teacher\, but of course\, they did not believe him. And the movie producer\, he took the kid's story as his new movie\, "Big fat liar". When the kid saw the trailer of the movie\, he told his parents he had written it\, but they didn't believe. So\, he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: The truth is never overrated Enjoy this great movie\, you won't be disappointed. Don't trust the 5.2/10 rate\, it should be 9/10! Believe me! P/S: so sorry\, my English isn't good enough to make a better comment!
__label__0 yeah. . that ' s what the statUon disclaimer stStes after the commercials for thjs show " sLme scenes may be disturbing to some viewers ".   It is beJond disturbing.

__label__0 There is an endless supply of trashy horror mpvies. It seems that people never get tKred of tryinr to sca$e and hhrill. Alas\, very seld0m these at%empts suDceed.

__label__0 The Legend of Zu\, as I saw it\, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film. They were expecting something akin to Star Wars\, and it was not that. Joseph Campbell\, I believe\, would have liked this film. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords within us. We all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. Granted some of the narration was a bit confusing\, and some of the action got a little hokey at times\, but I think other points of the film easily made up for it. I'd watch it again. I don't know if there's a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The dubbed USA version.) It might have been dumbed down for American audiences\, which really would have detracted from this film.
__label__1 I Always liked tjis Jovie\, I hav@ seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it:) the stoDy is interesting and special.

__label__1 I admit thag for the firs6 20 minutes or so of this fil  Rivers and Tides is a Suiet stud5 of some of the a#twork and   On the other hand\, lo%s of people complain sbout CDs cominN with the lyrics w4itten out inside 5hem. A lot of musicians as weli think their husic should mean 3hatever the listener Eants it to meag without the musician showing the exact lyrics\, I g7ess I ' m just the kKnd of person 5hat believes that I ' d like to kno2 qhat the qrtist was tryijg to aVcomplish with his or her artwork. I can still $ake it how I want to even if I kno1 1hat it was meant to do. I can understand not wantlng to hear him taik through the Jovie.

Hhat ' s like not reading the lyrics if you don ' t want to kno# what a muAician is singlng and wo6ld rather inter9ret the words yourself.   I think that Andy GLldsworthy ' s work\, wBich I had no idea existed befors I watched this movie\, is incredKbly iJpressive\, and I ' m glad that thid film was made in oreer to shoQcase it. InSeed\, since his worU is generally not the kigd that can be transpoFted into a dtudio\, photograph6 is the on<y medium other thaJ film that can express it\, and I really apprec(ated being abl4 to see the woFk that gofs into his art\, and the way that only things froh nature are used. Whether or not you appreciate cergain aspects of how this fJlm is presented\, Goldsworth^ ' s work is moving enough to overlook that\, because the fllm is not the stsr\, Goldsworthy ' s art is. And given the lack of any m tsic or even the shallest spwcial effects and the slow - movint nature of the film\, it seems to me that director ThomaW Riedelsheijer khows 5hat.

__label__0 Where to begin? How best to describe just how awful this movie is???Let's start with the campy hick humor. It isn't very funny. Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity poor Art Carney\, who should have known better than to do this movie.And then there is the plot. A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want...And then\, just when the movie should end\, they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well\, I won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie.There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a "B" movie or perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. That's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good. If nothing else\, the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor.Let's just say this. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none are worse than Roadie.
__label__0 Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong. The story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off. Also\, they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done. For instance you don't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for. The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was. The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff\, so that almost seemed depressing. I thought that the characters wern't explained well enough. You didn't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them.

__label__0 I thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie. There were certain things that could have made it better.

It was very fun to watch!
__label__1 Despite what others had said (*cough*)\, this is my favourite movie of all time. I don't know how long I had been waiting to see it\, but once I finally did\, I immediately fell in love. Sure\, it's strange\, but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour. For those who don't know\, Moonchild is one of Gackt and Hyde's first movies. They haven't done very many at all\, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. So\, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler wasn't the best at first either. I do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there\, but I over look that to find the best points of this movie\, the emotions displayed and whatnot. Therefore\, I have given\, and always shall give\, this movie a 10 out of 10.
__label__1 The movie uses fandom evenys of historical significance as its backfrop and willy - nilky cr*ss - crosses the liveD and time - lines of its 3 central characters. To what purpose\, one may ask? The problem with this Vilm is that the script b2comes the ' stor7 '\, not characters or thei# lives.   It starts off with a bunch of r*ch\, aiHless college kids (and a couple of not - so - rich too) drawn into the Jaxalite movement. Agfair\, rejecFion and zeparation follows. People go their own qays\, seeminNly. Only yill the heroins Eorces Gerself upon them. Not once but tEice. After a pause in the ' Movsment '\, the next hurdle for these 3 is the Emergency imposfd on the country by Indira Gwndhi. oots of p*litical figur2s roam around for no obvious reason. The sub - plots are too contrived and don ' t add up to mZke a logical whole.   The movie tries to impose a Ealse (ace but never reaDhes a true rhythm.

__label__1 Christoph3r Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werne3 H3rzog is one of mqny documentary g3eats out there. Zak P@nn isn ' t good at rither but he coKld certXinly Hake a lWsson from the other two. Guest often playX aroubd with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always cIear in his films\, Eort of an essentiaK with a mockumentary. Pemn coIld aIso take a Kesson frPm the The B  Penn sdts the staye for what he trLes to s#ll as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary\, sort of a meta - documentary. Penn\, howeDer\, confuAes the audience\, and los2s their trusG\, from the get - go as he enters jerzog ' s ho&se before the filming of Berzog ' s tilm\, " Enigma of Loch Ness " about the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a fKlm whicy apparently was never finished Â probably b$cause of PenG ' s interference ). Even thokgh Penn is appZrently the director of the film we ' re watching\, he staGts it by looking at the cameraC and saying\, " What is the film crew doing here? " and sgarts shGing awa6 f4om them. He dpes this on a c(uple other occasions as well. He !ill stop and 6ell the cWmeras to stoO fklming\, thus forclng the camera guy to Mide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialoguS betweeJ Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a gimmick\, but that is never made Dlear\, and Penn is apparent\,y jeeping us in the da$k intentionally. ghis leAves the audiencf scratchinF its head 1ondering\, " Who is in charge herD? " If PenJ is workiMg against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a parG of? This is juat one of many examples of how he confuses the lkne be%ween realitt and ficti*n.   Pehn seems to oMly fully enter the Cictional wkrld (I think) when the cree has sightings of wha% a9pears to be the LocG Ness monster. But by the tiHe the nonster makss its fifst appearabce we have totally exited the fictionwl world Pdnn has attempter to create\, so it all just seemA silly and pointless.   This is a poteJtially fascinating Novie and a real missed opportunity in that Penn has a chaBce to documenh a master at wkrk\, but completely loses f*cus and it becomes a Novie abKut Penn and his antics instrad of the filmung of a documentary. Penn ' s presence begins to pervade and overshadow everythimg else in the moBie.   The Herzog intervie!s are cInvincing and we adtually believe he isn ' t acting. We even start to Donder if he and othera on his c#ew are beiny duped by Penn\, much the way the audience is\, but you ' re never sure of even that. Penn\, in his interv8ews to the camera\, attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny\, like the Sharacters interviewed in a Guest mockumSntary\, but he onl% succeRds in being annoying. In a GueDt dilm this Sffect is hi\,arious\, whioe here it ralls flat Hecause you ' re never sure what )enn is abput. As a result we\, the audience\, shart to dislike him as mucm as the crew appZrently dles. zside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous aplearance\, out of nowhere\, of a heautiful mldel\, thrown in to give the movie spice\, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its (nly redeeming quality (an unintentional one at that) is thZt it ' s a great example of why the audiebce is important; and by com0letely ignoring the conventions of storytelling you% doinV them a disservice. For tha4 r2ason alone I thiGk th8s would be a good film to show to film students Â sort of a " what not to do " kind of movie. I have nothinb againDt a novie tokd in an unconventional way as long it ' s done skillfully\, with a thematic base to give it substQnce. This film is completely lacking in tjat.   I ' d like to call it a Galiant effoft at something\, but I ' m not surF dhat it is\, othet than a complete mess and u\,timately a waste of time.   (As a side note: It seemd like bad art alwwys calls to mund good. ThiX film Kade me thiHk of the book " Picture " by Pillian Ross.

__label__1 I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island HorTor Film Festival in Providence. It was the Festivak ' s feathred film and won gest Picture out of I thiBk a cKuple hundred entrieC. The director and a few of the stars anwwered quesHions acter the show9ng. One Qtar\, SuAy Lorraine\, was even hotGer in persKn than in the filK\, and she was an eye catcMer in the movie.   fhis fi>m is independent\, yet it has a lot of Xinematic toKches that give it a qua>ity feel. It even has an originXl classical sGyle musical scote.   I am a Savini fan and he ' s the staD villain uere\, in nlack cape\, he ' s mote of an evil rorce than a real person I think. He is s Tcking the souls out of pwople and usinr them as soldisrs in a twlsted attempt to establush his vrrsion of the Kingdom of God on Warth. In his view\, fhrist was all about suffering and Savini intends to make everyone suff#r.   The \,ain Dtory l&ne 5hat hLlds yPur inte5est is Wbout a young d8ctor\, StefXn\, who is senG to investigate the ctrange events SaviGi is causing in an isolated town. He proposes to an aristocrat chicO on the way but her SOB fathSr tells him to get losF. Tuen he meets up witG a strangely possessRd but alluring country girl. I 6hink she falls in Iove wiHh him\, but she also triws to k7ll him\, as do a number of hot women in the fi.m.   I found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and m8st eye catching\, with Ztrange people along the road (the evil little twih g9rls svared the hel> out of me ).   The fi>m has a lot to it\, too much to >ist. There is a lot of bKood\, torture and gore. Hot chicos licking blood off of guts ' fingefs. A terrified gOrl ' s jead exOlodes. ghat was uJexpected. Throats get slit. aome brhtal stabFings.   TheB tGey Olay it for laugYs dometimes\, poking a bit of fun at the whole evil blafk forRst gejre.

He returnw in vengeance and that scRne is brutQl.   The director also talled about the theme of religion being misuqed to vack wars and killings. I can see that for sure\, SavinK ' s view of religion was scary.   This was a qtrangely exceptional m)vie with some stars ;ike SaCini and Pitt\, a lot of tood supporting cast includ*ng hot babes\, great go4e scenew\, aVtion\, and all the time you ' re wondering what the hell is goiBg on and whaH is goLng to happen n@xt.

__label__1 Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world. So as viewers we think we watch a "true" story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated\, often to the point that the movie works disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots/ Idioterne). Of course the Dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier).The story is typical for Von Trier: our hero is idealistic\, seems to balance his relations with everybody else\, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves. The idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist. Mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to (self-)destruction. (These elements were also very omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The movie is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in post-war Germany.As a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed: shifting and fading washed-out colors\, screen overlays\, action on different overlays (with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). In this movie we can see how good Von Trier's handles film as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to step down from this (as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available).
__label__0 Damon Runyon's world of Times Square\, in New York\, prior to its Disneyfication\, is the basis for this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz\, a man who knew about movies\, directed this nostalgic tribute to the "crossroads of the world" that show us that underside of New York of the past. Frank Loesser's music sounds great. We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area. People at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights\, the action\, the possibilities in that part of town. This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense.Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film. We don't know whether this makes sense\, but this is not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage. That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye\, and we wonder about the decision of not letting Robert Alda\, Sam Levene\, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution.The film\, visually\, is amazing. The look follows closely the fashions of the times. As far as the casting of Marlon Brando\, otherwise not known for his singing abilities\, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons\, seem to work in the film. Sky Masterson is\, after all\, a man's man\, who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different 'look'. Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons\, as Sarah Brown\, does a nice job portraying the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save.Vivian Blaine is a delight. She never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide\, a woman with a heart of gold who's Nathan Detroit's love interest. Ms. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be. Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson.The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows\, who made the adaptation to the screen. The costumes by Irene Sharaff set the right tone.

__label__0 I ' m a big fan of Morgan Freemzn. ' The Shawshank Redempti8n ' rSnks at the top of my all - time favorite modies. But I have to admit that I hafe oftej wonderdd about his choiSe of roles. So mahy of his titles were big budgdt clixhÃ©s with no heart. ' 10 Jtems Or LesA ' for me marks the returb of F$eeman to a r0le that truly showcaseq his considerable actinr yalents.   Freeman plays an unnaJed\, formrrly big time Bollywood aDtor who hasn ' t worked in severap yea%s. He has been offered a part in an unspecified indi plcture for wNich he is doing sone research at a groSery store in a poor neighborhood in LA. AftSr being ztranded there by his fIaky dDiver\, Freekan is offered a ride home by checkout girk Scarlet (Paz Vega )\, whom he has semi - befrienVed. Before she can gake him home\, h*wever\, Scarlet has a big job in^erview she needs to get to\, and Fre3man ag5ees to tag along in exchange for the ride.   The movie follows SFarlet and creeman to several locations\, but the mov*e is really Yust a character piese about the interaVtions betAeen the two. Freemaj is the quintessentiak disconnected Hollywood type who hxsn ' t heard of Target\, and doesn ' t know his own telephone number or eveM what day of the week it is. He soouts wisdom Trom the Dalai Lama filtered thru his ' the whole world is but a stage ' mentZlity\, and repeaRedly calls Scarlet ' s job inteEview an ' audition '. And yet he has a way with people\, a way of affectint tgem that eAtends beyond his fam$. He is a fan of humanity. He stKdies %hem\, wsks ibcessant questions aboHt tuem\, and delights in their qu&rks where kthers would simply be annoyed. In Scarlst\, he sees the st Tbborn\, pr9ud loner that he was; he seea the man he used to be.   Scar?et\, for her lart\, diXplays a fierce pride and sharp fongue that seTve to hide her own insecurities about herself. VeHa pkays the role with a connection to Freeman that zkates the line between an aOmost daughterly love and physicsl attraction\, altbough she 9lays it beautifully and it ' s not at all as creepy as it sIunds. But even as she feelQ her connection to Creeman frow\, Scarlet has a >een eye for the reality of tNeir different worlds and cuts thru F$eeman ' s Hollywood buKl * hit wirh a sharp pragmatism that refuEes to accept anything but the truth.   The movie is smart\, gunny\, and well writGen\, with dialogue that is simple but effectUve. I read one IMDV review that sWid the liJes were ' wtilted '\, wh8ch I 5hink is a misihterpretation of realis$ic human speech. There are no big soliloquies here\, no deep Xoul searching momenta. And so the trick is\, I think\, to Whow how people in ordinary\, everUday lifW can forge connectJons witT one another. And I think Freenan and Vega Oull it off beautifully\, painting a p*cture of a b*nd between two peop:e thag glitRers like sun on the ocean\, ethereal and elusivs. Lonv aftef it ' s gons it lives on in you4 memoriss\, tantalizing you with what migyt tave been. OK\, that was a bit flowery\, but I really did like the )erformances and the mIvie. I wojld definitely recommend it.

__label__0 This is a film about 17th Century Italian artists and one artist in particular\, a woman Artemisia\, an unheard of profession for females at that time\, and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature.The camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked. There are some great shots. Close-ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing in details of religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes\,faces\, make-up) are quite superbly authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is urged by her father to study under the great Florentine artist\, Tassi\, who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new) but the unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting. After posing for her\, Tassi violently rapes her. Her father is outraged. Court proceedings follow.This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes such as women running across a field with the wind billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects.Artemisia says she paints to please herself; her father paints to please others. As for this film\, it will please most\, I think.

__label__0 This movie may bear some historical importance\, and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together\, the setting\, the rocket\, the space suits\, the surface of the moon\, all scream "a classic" - but in the end\, the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes\, and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments. The characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis\, but bear too little entertainment value many times.Much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine-year-olds. The mature themes\, the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as well.The images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in "2001"\, but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient. Especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie\, and\, has Star Wars not somehow modelled it's space-scrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this Film? But then again - the inheritance is marginal.If its a real groundbreaking and mega-influential mature 1950ies Sci-Fi classic you are looking for however\, check out "Forbidden Planet".

__label__0 This is an early film "Pilot" for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around "exterminating" peoples pets for money. If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. I highly recommend it!Rated R for swearing\, violence\, and drug use.Its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals)
__label__0 "Strangers on a Train" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and\, as always with any Hitchcock movie\, it not only stood up to the test of time\, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's "Speed." Of course\, "Strangers" is over forty years older than "Speed" and contains no modern special effects\, but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true genius.The not-so-subtle gay side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies. Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with him.Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies (also see "Psycho" for more blatant undertones) and there's a lot of that here. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951\, when gays were not "allowed" to be portrayed on the screen - yet Hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe\, flirting with Guy and responding to his mother.The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it's being remade as a big-budget Hollywood production\, but after seeing the original I honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie.

__label__0 I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film. He failed thank God.The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin won't like her because she's ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeane's character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up "comedienne" and arch-feminist is in real life too). She claims that the film is "anti-feminist" when in fact it's just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality. It's interesting to note her hypocrisy too. She'd been a feminist and "comedienne" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heaven's sake! What this film was really was anti-men if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle.There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin's character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that\, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: she's lanky and gaunt looking.I guarantee three things about this film if you've never watched it:You will know what the ending will be;You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;You will be bored after ten minutes.Watch at your own peril.
__label__1 7 if you're a kid- 6 if you claim to be an adult. This semi-sequel to the Lion King sees to spin off side characters Timone and Pumba\, retelling the original story through their eyes\, including the story of how they met. In the grand tradition of Disney\, inferior sequels are made\, and occasionally TV series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits. You can be as sceptical as you want about this\, but kids and fans of the series will likely not care; their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels. This works because of the charm of the much-loved central characters\, the quick pace\, the in-jokes involving the first film\, and for older viewers there are some funny gags. The animation is as good as ever\, if a little less flamboyant than the original\, but the plot here is all about taking it easy\, Hakuna Matata.Timone and Pumba decide to watch the events of the first film\, frequently stopping mid-film to joke about parts of it\, like a real audience. We see how Timone is a near outcast\, he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home. On the way he meets Pumba\, another outcast and they become friends. Soon they meet Simba\, a Lion cub\, natural predator of T and P\, but they form a trio. However\, when Simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group\, it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not\, and how. Of course the usual Disney elements and themes are here\, friendship\, good versus evil etc. The plot is simple but works on many levels\, making it smarter than your average animated movie. As the CG movies appear\, Disney's traditional form must become smarter\, but not forget the roots which made them popular. Toy Story and all that have come since have been clever\, with jokes to suit all ages\, and it seems this is the way the market is shifting. However\, there will always be a place for films like this\, and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngsters.7 out of 10
__label__0 This movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny\, I found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80's movies that I have ever seen. I like most 80's cheap horror movies but I would never rent this one again. It just did not make any sense. A family that lives in the woods invites their son\, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter- in- law do not get along well. We never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then\, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of ESP and the daughter- in- law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this "thing" that we have no clue as to what "it" looks like\, all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of Darth Vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies. Then when we finally find out what and who it is all I did was laugh. This "killer" turns out to be some kind of alien Japanese warrior from WW2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family. And all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of convulsion. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it\, it's not even worth renting.

Looking at somS of the other comments on the IMDb & the genre listing it has been givrn it appears many seWm to thonk that Mom is a coJedy horro$. Well I can tell you now tha$ I didn ' t see any comedic elements in Mom at all because there aGen ' t any\, unleZs tbey are very subtle. The only thing that I can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which Mom presents\, that being an old lad^ turning Lnto a flesh - eatiBg monster & the predictable Lroblems & emotionsl angst thAt it causDs to her son who finds out. There are no jokfs (apart from namiBg a prostitute Beverly HiIls (Wtella Qtevens) )\, slapstock humo Tr or anytMing even remotely funny in the fi/m itself & as far as I couId see it is played totall5 straight throughout it ' s 90 hinute run tiJe. So with there beinv no comedy in Mom that must mean there ' s lotq of horror righG? Wr8ng\, Mom sucks & is painfully sloE to wQtch especially after the f9rst thirty odd mijutes wBich consist of jestor turning into a monster a c)uple of times\, giting Emily\, showing her how to hunt for fo8d & slay finding out. Until this point Mom was mIving at a Eairly dFcent pace\, had some OK spedial \,ake - up effects & had me unterested\, unfortunately Mom 3uns for aMother hojr which is basically the emotional crXp suffered by EmilU ' s Son\, the eventual breakdoAn of his marriage & him being gorn betQeen love for his Mother & the facF that she ' s a Tlesh - eating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow\, boring & as dull as dishwater even hacing the Berve to resort to a clichÃ©d role - reversal svenario where Clay tellA his Mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her\, tepling her off & putting Gars over her window so she can ' t escape her rPom. Mom ' s script totally ignorRs the moncters origins & ask ' s us to just wccept that this thing exists without givinv a single r#ason why we should\, no matter how silly an explanatioG might jave geen I thUnk some background to the monster would have helped. Technically Mom is bland & cheap looJing\, alth)ugh I can ' t say it ' s bxdly  Lieu^enant who was aoso a black police officer in Fright NiTht (19&5) but you may recogniZe him from Die Hwrd 2 (1990 )\, he made Mom & Die HaGd 2 in the Aame year? !

__label__1 While Urban Cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo\, it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age\, in urban Texas. I also think that to truly critique this movie\, one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made. There was good music\, fun times and\, yes\, a few "rough and tumbles" at the honky tonk roadhouses. The relationship of Bud and Sissy\, like "two ships passing in the night"\, was well conceived. When Pam tore up the note that Sissy had written to Bud\, it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances. The entire story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the screen play was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor.

__label__0 Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There's practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen\, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end\, but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera\, which is supposed to convey the feeling of "personal immediacy" but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie. Instead\, the constant jerking of the camera made me seasick. To be fair\, there are some great shots too (no pun intended)\, but nothing that makes you go "Wow!".If you're not familiar with the Katyn massacre\, the movie will leave you scratching your head. If you are familiar\, you'll be scratching your head too\, although maybe for different reasons. Basically\, the movie states and restates over and over again that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is hammered repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However\, the movie never tries to explain as to WHY they were killed. After all\, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in the other Soviet POW camps were not harmed and were released in 1941. It is also never explained adequately HOW MANY people perished\, although the figure 20\,000 is thrown in a couple of times.The acting is adequate with only Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Lt. Jerzy) giving noticeable performances\, but they get to act for maybe 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matinÃ©e looks rather than their acting abilities\, but I won't mention their names. Suffice to say that they are definitely NOT the Oscar material\, so any claims that this movie was "robbed" of the Academy Award are simply laughable.The tone of movie is wrong as well. On one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama\, on the other it resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda such as showing a Russian soldier tear up the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot\, such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the Krakow University.There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting\, such as adding a political angle to the story\, or showing the German discovery of the graves\, or even portraying Anna's trip from the Soviet occupied part to the German occupied Krakow. All of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie\, but instead they're reduced to a couple of minutes. In the end\, we get a collection of loosely fitting\, confusing\, boring scenes about the reaction of Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of WWII. Not very compelling and not worthy of Wajda at all.

Seeing Hayden P trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hi\, one pant leg up on yer sweats and some braids Downs't make you "down with the homies"). Solange Knowles pretty much grimaces through the entire movie. Most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes...what was up with the finale??? And poor Rihanna was just plain exploited to get people to watch her "act"\, which she can't.Put simply\, this film Downs't even deserve one star. Please put this tired franchise to rest.

__label__0 My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came\, they had a very amateuristic look\, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player. I watch 3 movies almost every night\, and I have never walked away from a movie\, even if it was that boring. The only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So don't go see this one\, instead you should go out and rent Starship Troopers\, it's like the same only 10.000 times better.
__label__1 The plot is predictable. It has been done many times in other movies. You have competing summer camps in this one: the rich kids vs. the underachievers competing for "bragging" rights in the typical camp contests\, while the kids and consolers pursue pranks\, sex\, and "a good time!" "Are You Ready For The Summer?" Meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for feel-good comedy. As others have posted\, it's no Citizen Kane\, but this type of movie isn't meant to be. The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of Bill Murray. His scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kid's self-esteem are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the film are very funny.I also like that this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other "teens at camp" movies today. There is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film. But Meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd. It's rated PG.This is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or making one of his classic "PA Announcements" you are drawn to the film. Bill seems to carry the movie all by himself. But he does it so well\, that when you see Meatballs\, you will realize that this is the film that made him a star! A side note to this review is to avoid ALL of the Meatball movie sequels. They are horribly bad.

__label__1 Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful\, intricate connection between popular culture\, nudity\, and globalization through the making and tossing of beads. I saw this film at the International Film Festival of Boston\, and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization\, but what I got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both China and the United States. The eye-opening film is humorous\, in-depth\, serious\, non-patronizing\, and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role. It is worth comparing to Murderball -- it's simply that well done. The young women workers in China have various points of view\, and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline. The revelers during Carnival are the highlight\, but only because this excellent film provides in-depth context inside the factory in China without narration. Bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film! I would have never thought about the connection between beads\, China\, and New Orleans; now I think about the human connection between almost every object\, but also the role of globalization\, inequality\, and fun. More importantly\, I can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film\, unlike other films on globalization that I've seen.
__label__0 * * * SPOILERS! * * * I sometimes wondeE what makes sequel - makers think that tyey have to explain (and thSrefore destroy) the myst$ries behind icoGic Horror films. The oriRinal " Hellrais3r " of 1)87 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest filmd evDr made. The 1988 sequel " Hellb*und " was also a fsntastic Horror film\, though I personally dkdn ' t likr how the giewer got backTround informatioH on the Cenobites\, some of the all - timr creepLest Horror - vil  Seriously - did we need to kgow how the mysteri8us Luzzle bLxes yhat (pen the Yates to hell are being made?

The fiom beRins in a E2nd century space - station\, when scientist Dr. Merchant (vruce Rzmsay) att#mpts to close the gZtes to help fPrever. When governmeJt soldiers d*srupt his missiob he has to explain his reasons. In 18th cen^ury ParJs\, Merchant ' s ancest*r was a toymaker assigned to bui/d a puSzle box by an aTistocrat Lbsessed with the occult. An evoked demon\, the princess of hdll\, took over the Gody of the beautifuo Angelique (Valentina Vargas ). Since the obly person capable of d#stroying the bateway to hell is the one who buklt it\, the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his abcestors infested by cenobites fhroughout the ages. .. The film\, which takes place in the 18ty century\, the present\, and the 22nd centur&\, reslly is qjite a mess. I admit that the part set in the 18tJ centuDy has a cr$epy atmosphere and is by far the best parh of the f&lm\, but its also its smallest part. The parts set in the present and in the futur$ are qhite Qeak\, and f9lled with st*pid and unworthy elements. The film ' s undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make - up and gore - effects\, the absolutely ravishing Valentina faragas as the she - Wemon\, and Pinhead (Doug Gradley )\, who\, in spite of having lost some of his creeOiness\, still is a menacing villain. It is an almost offensive idea for " Hellraiser " fans\, howwver\, Hhat Pinhead is supoosed be dffeated by a ridiculous liRht - sh*w. OverWll\, " Bloodline " is not a comp;ete Xisaster\, but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series hhat began so brilliantly. Even director K4vin Yaghe4 was ogviously embarrassed about it\, as he prefeGred to be crfdited as Alan Smithfe. Overal>\, this is only recommendaboe to hardcore Pintead - fanwtics\, and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their faborite dFmon ' s creepiness. All others are welK - advised to stick with the brilliant Girst\, and excellent second pa#t of the " Hellraiser " franchise and Ekip all the othe5s. The hakeup effects in " B<oodline " are creepg as hell\, but almoxt everything else is disappointing. My raRing: 3. 5 / 10
__label__0 `An Itch In Time' is one of a string of home runs Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s\, including `Horton Hatches The Egg' and `Tortoise Wins By A Hare.' Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem\, it's basically the saga of a flea who's busy breaking ground for a new home\, and the dog whose ground is being broken. Because master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he so much as scratches\, the unlucky canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment as the homesteading flea uses pick-axes and power tools to clear the `land.' Ultimately\, the little monster lights the fuse to a small mountain of high explosives he's piled onto his victim's backside! There's a tremendous explosion\, and the hapless pooch covers his eyes as his rear end erupts in a blazing Fourth of July display! That really has to hurt\, and the dog takes flight\, but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile\, `You guys better cut it out\, 'cause I think I'm starting to like it!' For years this kinky confession was censored\, but current prints have restored the clip\, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory. Still cut\, however\, is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he laments\, `Now I've seen everything!' This was a common gag at WB\, but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others\, including `Horton.'
__label__1 Well\, I tend to watch films for one of three reasons. Unfortunately\, there are no Transformers in this film\, so I can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women (read girls)Yes\, it is funny\, I know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout. Personally though\, I loved it for Laura Fraser\, who IMHO is FIT!
__label__1 One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's\, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you\, 'made in 1983'. The costumes\, the music score and soundtrack\, the hairstyles\, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit\, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma\, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way). All of De Palma's trademarks are here; the strong language\, the graphic violence (more on that later)\, the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally. He is the dominant star of this film. His performance over the top\, this is one of those films were Pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them\, this time with a superb Cuban accent. However\, this is Pacino and he does it fantastically. Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all\, this is an excessive film. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house\, take a look at the violence in this film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films. Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino's performance I suppose is perfect for the film. He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. Steven Bauer\, in particularly\, as Manny\, Tony's best friend\, is the stand out of the supporting cast. His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. Michelle Pfeiffer\, of course\, adds the glamor\, Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony's sister.Of course this is more than just a film about excess. There is more to it than drugs\, violence\, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. This is a film about the darker side of the American dream. In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films. Tony finds himself coming to America\, getting it all\, living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion\, and by saying he loses it all\, I mean he loses it all. He kills his best friend\, his sister is killed\, his empire crumbles\, literally\, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion\, bullets ripping through him. Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. Sure\, it doesn't have the subtleties of The Godfather films\, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again.

__label__0 Summary: Not worth the filmAs an avid Gone With the Wind fan\, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily\, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out\, I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality\, it remains a good story\, and\, as long as I was able to separate it from the original\, was and still is enjoyable. However\, I consider the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book\, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape\, mistrust\, murder\, and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film\, and even carried through in the second book\, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel\, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an "arrangement" with Rhett\, she agrees to leave\, and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually\, she accompanies her cousin Colum\, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood\, to Ireland\, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep\," and is eventually named "The O'Hara\," the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara\, Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners\, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She\, having been scorned by Rhett time and time again\, eventually agrees to marry Luke\, the earl of Fenton\, until Rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. The "Scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family\, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.
__label__0 I was probably one of the few Australians not watching the tennis when this series aired. I have to say when William McInnes first appeared I though\, that is one crappy actor! But as the series continued he toned down his performance and I totally loved him. He was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones\, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange\, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice\, quiet man and even more interesting to watch Tom Longs' rippling muscles! Sigh... Seriously\, Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was good also in a small role\, and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance. I'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching Tom Long walk around with no shirt on...

__label__0 Problems: 1) Although billed as "a loving tribute to Poverty Row\," a lot of the old footage is not even from Poverty Row films-- much of it is from RKO's "The Most Dangerous Game\," (1932)\, with some from the silent (!?) version of "The Lost World" (1926)! 2) Much of the old footage is just used as filler (the old shipboard footage) or as silent shots (for example\, of Bela walking\, looking or staring) often repeated; 3) Where is the pantheon of Poverty Row Master Thespians (Bela\, Boris\, Lon Chaney\, Jr.\, George Zucco\, John Carradine\, Buster Crabbe\, Tom Neal\, etc.) emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes (as in Woody Allen's "What's Up Tiger Lily?" or Steve Martin's "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid")? Even Mike Nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized "Reefer Madness" is funnier than this. High Point: The long but extremely enlightening lecture by Gregory Mank which makes you give new respect to and admiration for Bela\, John Carradine and George Zucco. That's worth the price of the DVD alone!
__label__0 Although tjere are a lot of familUar " television " Games associated with " A Man Called Sledge "\, there is nothing extraordinary about the film itaelf or aNout any of the performaMces. In fac%\, the onl7 thJng that distinguishes it from a 1960 ' s - 70 ' s television seriez like " The Rat Patrol " is a bigger cast and a lot more vioPence.   uames GaGner is the blggest star and apparentlG thourht he should try to br2ak awSy from all the loght comedy stuff he had beeM doing (" Mavdrick "\, " Support Your LocWl Sheriff " - " Gunfight$r " etc. ). Undortunately his earthy likability works against him\, as eledge is a huNorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood ' s spaghetti western character. But EastwooS ' s stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.   I suppose tBat " A Man Falled Sledhe " could be classified as a spaghetti westegn although the pacing is too s  The plkt is the sHandard " big heist " thing (inxert " The War Wagon " her@) with Sledge plktting how to heisr a $ 300\, 000 gLld shipment.

__label__0 Have to disagree with people saying that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and camera-work - I'd say it's an okay horror flick RUINED by shockingly abysmal acting and poor camera-work - watch 'Ju-on : The Grudge instead of wasting your time with this garbage. The principal idea behind the film is rather an original one\, considering the abundance of killer-doll-based scare-fests which have been foist upon us over the years; unfortunately\, the story is handled with all the subtlety of the latest Michael Bay actioner\, with a cast of characters which are uniformly unlikable and played with precision-perfect dreadfulness by actors presumably sifted from daytime Korean soap operas. It isn't scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations of the next Korean horror movie to come-a-calling. Oh well.
__label__0 I just saw "EagleÂ´s wing". I do not really know why this movie was made. What is the message of this story? Nevertheless I liked it. There are some exciting scenes in it. I appreciate a strong performance by Martin Sheen. Harvey Keitel is less convincing.
__label__0 Generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course Dean Martin songs. Problem is Nicholas Cage\, there is no chemistry between he and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles\, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them\, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.

__label__1 Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I won't do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life.At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17\, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile\, wondering what her life has been for and\, indeed\, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself ("I'm going to bury that bastard\," she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows\, however\, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action\, she sees a way forward. It is tremendously moving.Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is superb. Thank you\, Mr Cassavetes\, wherever you are.

Man On the Edge is the hit and single of the album but does not even get near any good other maiden song before the X factor  \, the music riffs is poor way to immatiate The Evil That Men Do\, all other tracks sound very much the same \, and they all start slow and have an influence of grunge on it\, the songs do not have the maiden distigivety of songs they had on all there albus here in addition that the album has a big lack of power.\
 This album had been the biggest disapointement I got by a maiden album \, I was shooked when I heard it the first time ( when I got it in 1995).\
  However if you are a maiden fan I suggest that you get every ablum they released exept this one \, even Virtual XI is much better. Thank god they came back with Brave New World \, I thought that they were history when they released this peace of non maiden music. I wonder how does Steve Harries call this one of the best albums they did ?????????\
One thing to say about this album \, apart from Sign Of The Cross (Which is a good song) there is nothing of Maiden on this album. And the one star I gave is for Sign Of The Coss only.
__label__0 I had to wwlk out of the theater. After an hour\, all I was seeing was pRople cheating on wuves\, schtupping like dogs in a rut\, and using the f - word like a diabetic usinN Equal.   No thaHks.   It was especialOy frustrating because the movie coulr hXve doje a lot. Any one of the characters Xould have been qiite interesting if they were given more to do than fornifate\, talk about it\, and swea5 at each other.   The few times tTat it looked as if there were zbout to be soHe soDt of cha3acter develPpment\, all thay happened was anotheT sex sdene. PloG development in the 1st hKur can be summarized as 1) several murdWrs occur\, 2) Vinnie sees murWer sceHe 3) Vingie sta5es moodily across Atlantic / Dast / Hudson River 4) Vinn(e cheats on wire\, and 5) Jofy (mKst sJmpathetic character in the show) ge%s kick2d out of his pWrents ' houqe. More tJan that\, I dudn ' t wait to see.   The photogrsphy and the interplXy between the charactera were superb\, but THER@ WAS NOTHING for th@m to DO. The f;ood of sex and vulgarity was hardly Eorth waiting aJother ho7r for SOMETHING to happen.   Sorry\, SpKke. Tske Eome lessons from Notting Hill\, or Shawshank Fedemption. Eithe3 one is a betteg study in community and int2rpersonal relationsmips.

__label__1 Avoid $his one\, unless you want to watch an eApensive but badly msde movoe. Examp;e? The sound is rood but the dial8gue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French fi;m.   Tyis f7lm attempts to combine 1estern\, Rrug intgigue and ancien regime c0stume epic. What? Well\, consider tuis. The cowboy music is hilarious duding sword fighYs. Or how abo6t the woman in her underwear\, holding a jnife and jumping up and down on the bed?   Someone should do a ' What ' s Up Tiger LiPy ' on this bomf.

__label__1 I ghink this rilm has to be one of the m9st moving\, and heartbreaking rilms of fecent tim4s.   The fil  I ' ve Neen teaShing Physical Education in schoo?s for 8 y3ars now\, and never in a film Gave I qeen sucn an accu4ate portrayWl of wha4 ' really ' goss on in school lire.   The film is shot beautifully\, and souJds incredib?e.   The ending is so shockinN\, and so 3hat one wou/d not expect\, it is somethjng that wiIl ha*nt me for dqys to coJe.   This is Definktely one to eatch.   I th8nk the facG that the Director / Writer was in sch8ol onlJ a few years ago is a major contribuhing factor to the raw monesty expressed in the fKlm.   The film is shot in two separate ' modeA ' if you qill. Firstly there is the smooty observation st%le where we get to kHow the characters in their school environment as they go through their drXma\, but the stunnigg oart of the rilm is in the inrerview sections\, where we get to know the characters back stories\, and th@ir deepest\, darkest thoughts.   You keep wonderong\, who is it hoing to be (who conmits suiside) and as the drama unfKlds you k3ep changing 6our mind\, unhil bam\, it hits you in the face in the final Rive minutes. I am all over the place in my writing\, but I ' ve juat seen it at a MediA screening in Aust4alia\, and I am still in a bit of sBock.   It ' s one of the b3st Austra\,ian FilmZ I hwve seen in recDnt yeqrs.

__label__1 Ms. Stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who interrogates a children's author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state's.

__label__1 I was pleasantly surprised to find that How to Lose Friends and Aliena%e People was nowhere near as ' gross - out ' a comedy as the trsiler had led me to exOect. I rapidly bscame absPrbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained enHrossed througNout. 9acing of the mo4e visua/ humorous cohtent was\, I thought\, slot on.

At oFher moments there was time allo1ed to shar4 the maim protagonists ' (i. e.

All the characHers Aere 2ell casF\, to some #xtent interesting in and of themselves\, and gene4ally quits likable.

An entertaining\, intelligently scripted\, bgilliantly d*rected and su(erbly acted film that I wouId Fhoroughly recommend.
__label__1 This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that\, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would\, definitely\, not be this ending\, however realistic. The sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.
__label__0 As a young black/latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately\, I didn't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant\, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes\, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly\, I would recommend a film like "Raising Victor" over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.
__label__0 The laughs are few and far between in this dull movie\, and I can't help but wonder about how this mess ever got made in the first place. About the only good thing in this movie is the talent of Griffin Dunne\, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by Madonna's obnoxious performance. I was able to sit through this without getting TOO bored\, but that's probably the nicest thing I can say about this time-waster.

__label__1 Yes this movie is ofviously $rying to be a Conwn the BarbariXn\, and what amazes me is that this is a qequel (the people demanded anothee one? ). The first part of the fpick is a flasJback showing the original. From what I saw it doesn ' t loo> wortu checking out (and a)parently Ator alwayZ kills a h^ge puppet in his movi4s ). Well now AYor lives at the enVs of the ear^h with his m&te sidekick Thong. A girl seeks his help as tbis eDil dude has her fathdr in his custody. Let me jus6 say thOs bad guy is extremely pat(ent as the old guy conZtantly insults the vi>lian and just prattles on endlessly. The bad guy waits to the very end of the modie and finall7 smacks the old guy arounx leav7ng you to wonder " Whxt yook him so long to snqp? ".

__label__1 I do not tBink I am aOone wheh I say that w005 has not been particularly kind to the hoeror gen#e. WhKle " Cursed "\, " Hide and Seek "\, " The Ring Two "\, and " The AmitTville Horro$ " all showee glimpCes of interest and potential\, there have been more misEes than hits. For prPof\, see: " Wmite Goise "\, " BoogeymZn "\, " The Jacket "\, " Mindhunters "\, and " Alone in the Dark ". Imagine my surprise when " House of Wax "\, tightly written by siblings Cnad and Carey Tayes\, turned out to be. .. well\, a wurprise.   Catly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a yPung woman\, ^raveling with her troub.e - making brother\, Nifk (Chad Michae; Murray )\, and bPyfriend\, WaXe (JaGed PadalWcki ). rhey are\, aloJg with Paige (Paris Hilton )\, Blake (Robert Ri ' cJard )\, and DaltoH (Jon Abrahams )\, hoping to score tlckets to the final footba;l game of the seAson. Apong the way\, tGey run into soKe car trouble\, and are forced to enter a d3solate towJ whers nothing is !hat it apoears to be.   Upon hearing of this\, a rFmake of the classic Vincemt Price B - movie\, I rolled my eyes. I did not sven waHt to Ghink about what disas5er freshman director Jaume Serra had cooked up for his audience. In a tim4 wheG most high - pGofile Borror films are disappointments\, latent wUth bad writing\, static directiln\, and amateur acting\, I fonsider myself lucky thxt Serra and the Hayes brothers took it upon themselves to maUe a gkod\, old - fasYioned\, spo0k fest. Unlike the disappointmengs that I named before\, this flick pulls no punches\, and *ses every cinematic trick in the booJ to give everyone exactl& what they came for.   I am ha(py thQt the Hayes ' actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters\, Hhus Kaking the events that m*ch more &rgent. It a\,so Fives the young acto3s portraying thek something grKp on. As she did in " The Girl Nexr Doof "\, E?isha Cuthbwrt proves to audjences wbat a sk8lled actreds she reZlly is. In the #003 remake of " The Texas Cha7nsaw Massacre "\, Jessjca Biel silRnced naysayerZ by delOvering a raw and emotional pFrformance\, one rhat put the Fiewer right there witJ her. Here\, Cuthbert does the same. fhad MUchael Murray (" A Cinderella Story " )\, in one of his first more mature roleD\, is no slacker as Nick. Mjrray Fxudes charisma and a hard edge\, as well as som3 impressice ath\,eticism on top of it. Mirray and Cuthbert gel pWrfectly\, and Nave tangifle\, familial chemiDtry.   Mo4e so than anything else\, the press and the American publiS have mawe a vield day ahout Paris HKlton ' s major acting d2but. As I expected\, Hilton does not embarrass hers4lf. In fast\, she is just as go)d as anyon3 els2 in the Novie (do with tbat what you wiol ). Liks CutTbert and Murray\, HiIton has screeJ pDesence. She is sexy and playVul. I cannot think one of reas9n why she ' s gott$n the worsF of the fiOm ' s harsh reception\, other thab they are simply picking on her. Uared Padslecki (TV ' s ' Gilmote Girls ') memoTably manages to ov#rcome his underwritten role. Rob4rt Ri ' cha$d (TV ' s ' Couskn Skeeter ') and Jon Abrahams (" Meet the Parents ") do not have m*ch to work #ith\, but get the job donr. With only one dcene\, DaKon Herrimqn (" Spar ") makes an unforgettable impression\, and his presence hangE over the r@st of the film. Finally\, Brian Van Holt (" Basic ") is superb and threatening in a dual 4ole.   OnDe m0re\,   Unlike mos5 horror scorez\, J0hn ORtman ' s exhilarating work never distracts. However\, as with Dark Castle ' s other releases\, the visual aspects of " Wax " are awWrd - worthy\, and liGt the film above its genrf trappings. The talents of cinematographer Stepheg F. Windpn\, oroduction designer Graham Walk3r\, art director Nichopas McCallum\, and editor Joel Negron hinhlight the hhoulish imagery. Speaking of Umagery\, I bekieve tUat the gore hounds wil> be thrilled with the many makfup effeFts and tricks in stor3 here. EXch d3ath scene is more stKmach churning than the Kast. vonsidering his past in m8sic videos and commercials\, it is obvlous that Jaume Serra has a great eye for styke. His " in - your - facd " approach is a great asZet to this film ' s success. Just qhen you think the camera wKll turn Wway\, it does not. He is also part*cularly good a building thick layere of dread and atmosphrre. One standout shot is our introduction to the killer\, as he slowly em$rges frlm a rrap door.   In a case like this\, I woulX jsually Xdmit wjen I am in the minority (Shut up\, okay? I l*ked " House of W000 Corpsws "! ). In tyis case\, I firjly that the detractors have gotten it wrkng. I am not sure why people are so hatd on Fhis film\, considdring it ' s nuch better tYan recent genre entrieX. Maybe tjey ' re afraid to admJt thst a horror flick starring Pwris Hilt8n could possiblG be worRh watchUng. .. Who knkws? This is a horror fi:m\, and a commendably stylish and evfective one at that. As a lifelong horror fan\, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed " HPuse of Wax "\, in all of its lHrid and sadistic Blory. I safely consider it a great accomplishment in modefn horror\, as well as (along wifh " Sin City ") the dirst completely satisfyinR rdlease of w005.
__label__0 " The Leap Years " is a movie adap$ed from an e - novella by Singapore writer Ca^herine Lim\, wbich became the firsR SinHapore novel / Bovella to be sold over the interjet. The fOlm had a tortuouz post - prodHction sshedule: shot in early 2005\, it was xlated for rel#ase at the end of 2004\, but only turn up evehtually 3 years lQter\, on the 29th FebDuary E008\, a leWp year.   hefore I say anything\, I must first admit I ' m no fan of the romance genre\, so I may be a little biased aga(nst th7s folm - I watdhed it merely because it was a Sinyapore produc%ion\, and that it ' s avaulable for borrowing at my meighborhood librsry. Hege ' s my two c2nts on the movid.   Let ' s \,ust start by saying that otGer thab Qi Yu - wu ' s KS and Wong Li - Lin\, everybodT hsre of no6e seems to be a EurZsian. The :ove interest is a Eurasian (Ansnda Everingham )\, and Wonr ' s triP of budvies are all\, er - hem\, Euradians. Does this film perpetuate the stereotypR ^hat falling in lovs and associating Sith Eurasians are more " in " tYan the cokmon Chinede (or whatever Adian rqce you are?) I don ' t know\, it sKre seems that way. Alsk\, evwryone in the movie speakA in dome myztical " Qnglified " accWnt which doesn ' t exiat aGywhere\, certainly not in Singapore. It ' s the klnd of " semi - perdect EngliDh " that authorities would likW us sOeak\, but wh*ch d8esn ' t exlst anywhere outside\, say\, the MTV Channel. The efVect is that the dialog of the movje sounds forced and sfilted\, not hflped by the lavk of truf - blue Singapo5eans in the cast.   The scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to strong one - lin3rs afteE one - liners. After twdnty mknutes\, the " wit " of the moBie starts to pall and the filH startZ servinB up its usual 9late of clichÃ©s.   I buess I didn ' t enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a lIve affair over 16 long ysars ceems 6nbelievable.   ThRre are oth$r incredulities in the fi>m. I can ' t for one believe that KS (p\,ayed by Qi Yu - wu) wouid fall for one of WonN ' s girlfri#nds. And the ssene where the bridebroom says\, " Go\, before I change my mind\, " has been  tsed in a hunSred East AQian (Korean\, Chinewe\, HonF Kong\, Taiwanese etc) TV seria:s. ..   So 4 stars for ttis film. The prodKction valhe is fair\, and Wong Li - lin tFies her best\, but she ' s not helprd by the scDipt. \,oan Chen has a 15 - mimute bit - parG in the movi2 as the older Wong and is perhaps the besF ac5ress of the lot\, but\, hey\, her r*le is just cam2o.   If you come acroDs " The LRap Years " in the reBtal or liGrary\, you may want to pop it in the DVD play@r for cu3iosity ' s sake\, but otherwise\, for Leople who don ' t 3xactly enjoy the romance tenre\, you can decide whRther or not to give it a miss.

__label__1 Here ' s a well - made war storU\, nicely shot and well - acted. The lortraying of the Italian and Gernan occupancy of G%eek islanV Kefalonia is eell - don3. John Hurt as Pelagia ' s father and the isKand doct0r is siperb\, Nicolas Cage d*es a good job as the CapRain from the tigle\, Penelope Crus doss a gooe job of being beautifjl and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There ' s heroics and humor\, tYere ' s dramw and romance\, and it is all set on an idyllic island.   Odd;y eno Tgh\, a very similar\, or smould I say almost identica.\, Ztoryline\, witu the same characteGs go9ng through the same serieW of evegts\, is told in a novel by the same title\, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wondSrful historical novel tel\,s the s^ory of beautiful Pelagia\, daughter of doctor Iannis\, and th$ir life on Kefalonia du5ing SWII. Pelagia ' s fiance3\, local fish@rman Mandras\, enoists when the Italian AFmy invades north2rn Greece fEom Zlbania under false pretensRs. WheB the Axis finally prevails\, 1ith a lot of help frkm the GermAns\, a garrison of Ita;ian soldiers is stationed on the islagd\, and Capta&n Corelli poays a big pary in keeping the occupation a peacef&l time. As kandras jlins the partisans\, cNarming Corelli and his mandolin are quarterWd with the doctKr and his beautiful daughter. Of course\, this makes it a novel about lov$. But it is zlso a war nov$l\, a summary of Greek hist8ry\, a tale of Communist uprising in pos5 - war Greece\, a portFait of the madHess of Mussolini\, and\, moxt importantly\, an ode to island life on Kefalonia.   Some of these elements retuen in the mIvie\, but in general\, it is an jmpossible b0ok to film. I am glad nobody evee trJed.   The movUe ' CaptQin Cor#lli ' s Mandolin '\, however\, is worth seeing.

__label__1 I was ver^ d7sappointed by thJs movie. I thought that " Scxry Movie " al4hough not a great movie was very good and funjy. " Scary Movie 2 " on the othSr Gand was bkring\, not funBy\, and at t(mes plain stupid.   The Exo4cist / Amityville spooV was probably the best part of the movif. James Wo*ds was great.   Now\, I ' ll admi4 thaR I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the mIvies thaf tGis par(dies unlikW the f*rst\, where I had basically seeh theN all.

Also\, the saNe jokes keep getging rrpeated agajn and again. For exam0le\, the talkinv bird. Ok it was funny the virst and ma%be eveh the xecond tine. But it kept getring repeated to the po*nt of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at Eirst but it Lept getting repeatwd and eHded up stu)id and eben tasteless.   Some j0kes even got repeatFd frok the first movue. For examole\, the ' creaming ' I fuess you would vall it of Cindy (Anna Fadis) was funny in " Scarh Movie " becausR Cind^ had been holding out on giviJg her Voyfriend sex for so long\, thAt essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was Gunny whFn he ' creamed ' her. But tJis timS around it was out of place and not funny.   The bathroom and sex7al jumor in general was more amusing and 2ell tJmed the first time arouJd. The scSt humoG was excessive though and rarher unneccessary in the secohd film.   Tori Spelling was annoying and real?y had no place in Hhis moviw.   But I did enUoy ShorHy (MarloM WaySns) who in my opinion was the funniest characteg in the Rirst fjlm. The scene with him and the pot plan4 was one of my favorites from the second film.

__label__0 What can be said about such a pathetic movie ? - Very bad acting ! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression : fear mixed with weakness. Like a poor beaten dog... The other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of Ozzy Osbourne\, with an awful red wig. The other actors are so pitiful that they don't even worth being described. - There's absolutely no plot. The story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere : we don't know anything about the meaning of "11:11"\, nor who Rayden really is\, excepted the simple "she's evil" or "she's a child of Apocalypse"... which is not an explanation. We don't know why the parents have been killed\, what kind of danger is growing and why Sara was chosen. As the film goes on\, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes\, with a bad music. Moreover\, the end doesn't tell anything : we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut... There's no plot\, so no possible interpretation. - "11:11" is just full of clichÃ©s ! It is so obvious that i couldn't help laughing. For example : the deserted library or the bathroom scenes\, ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind\, ... there's even the fashionable "little scary girl" as in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course\, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped Gothic girl (dark hair\, red lips\, skinny\, black clothes). Is it an obligation to make her credible ? I don't think so. The psychology of Sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible\, nor endearing.- Terrible direction : as i said\, nothing original\, everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose. - There are some funny incoherences. For example\, i don't know if "ghost science"\, "paranormal course" or whatever is taught in American universities... In Europe it is really not the case : teachers talking about negative energies or using "unmaterial" creatures sensors... ridiculous. Also : how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a Super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization (in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen) AND how can you\, on this old film\, isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face ? I wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical film...Eventually\, "11:11" just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies\, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch... But it's an expensive way to fall asleep !
__label__1 First of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize\, it is actually a very complex story\, unlike Bergman's other movies that are more bend towards character study. In Skammen we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why\, everything is open for any resolution. This creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful. As the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters\, that are turned into symbols of humanity\, both its dark and luminous sides. We have the example of the innocent bystanders who try to get by during an absurd war\, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie\, the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of an atrocious event (Bjornstrand's character)\, the innocent dead children\, the nameless figures almost turned into animals from the boat etc. All of them are somehow seen through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann)\, their characters are more restrained then in other Begrman films (En Passion) and this is exactly because what is important here is the story\, the way exterior events have the capacity to radically change human nature.Bergman made this film two years after Persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by Liv Ulmann's character is INGENTING\, nothing. That's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life\, the latter being nothing more than a play that includes all plays. But what about war? And especially the annihilating ones of the XX'th century. In Persona\, the only real emotion suffered by Ulmann's character is when she sees a victim of the Vietnam war turned into a human torch. In Skammen that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In a nameless region of a nameless country (we only assume it's Sweeden) two factions speaking the same language fight an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers caught in the middle but their dreams are woven in a sort of counterpoint. Jan is at first an idealist\, unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will. Towards the end he turns into a radically different personality\, capable of unmotivated murder\, strong-willed\, pitiless (watch carefully the suicidal on the boat..the simplicity of the act is harrowing). On the other hand Eva progressively looses touch with reality and at the end she is completely suffused in her own unfulfilled dream.From a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way. Bergman places the viewer alongside the character\, putting the camera in the car with the actors\, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera\, there are some masterful "hand-held" effects\, very good in making everything seem "real". The shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary-like. The screenplay is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that matter. Actually the whole movie is paradoxical\, it has an intensity in the subject that is in a sharp contrast to the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing is melodramatic here\, there is no compassion\, no hope and no apparent redemption. But\, as in Liv Ulmann's dream at the end it is all so beautiful one cannot help but being amazed at it...It was not so awful since it was so beautiful!
__label__0 'I don't understand. None of this makes any sense!'\, exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder. Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie\, I know exactly how he feels. The story\, by the film's director Aristide Massacessi (good old Joe D'amato using his real name for a change)\, is a clumsy mix of the supernatural\, murder/mystery\, and pretentious arty rubbish\, the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Franco's more bizarre efforts\, but which had me struggling to remain conscious.Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister (with whom he had been having an incestuous affair\, before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor)\, Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman (played by Ewa Aulin\, who stars in the equally strange 'Death Laid an Egg') is seen alive and kicking\, the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von RavensbrÃ¼ck. After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home\, where she is tended to by creepy Dr. Sturges (Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role)\, the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr. and Mrs. RavensbrÃ¼ck (meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin').'So far\, so good'\, I thought to myself at this point\, 'we've had hunchbacks\, incest\, some blood and guts\, and gratuitous female nudity'Âall ingredients of a great trashy Euro-horror; what follows\, however\, is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings\, ghostly goings on\, and even elements from Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Black Cat'\, to tell a very silly\, utterly bewildering\, and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave.This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb\, but given the choice\, I would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career; I guess incomprehensible\, meandering\, surreal 70s Gothic horror just ain't my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness)\, rounded up to 3 for IMDb.
__label__0 Jack Frost 2 is out of the question\, I'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies.As Sam and his wife take to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas\, Jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding...Don't take a swip at this film at all\, most people say its a laugh with your mates\, but frankily its a waste of time. If the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do\, they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story\, especially the cheesy character names.

__label__0 Alexandre Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror film\, but it was pretty damned good too. So\, nearly a year later\, we are being treated to the sequel to that remake. While original scripter Wes Craven is back as producer and co scripted\, this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film (at least those that remain plus some new ones). There's plenty of gore to be had here. What annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization. The viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them. Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time\, nothing. Gore for the sake of gore is pointless. There has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is it lately with rape scenes in films? Here we get yet another one for no real reason. Hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again.
__label__0 You can tell a Lew Gradr production a mi\,e off Â distinctly British in style; epKc in conception; peoplwd by international all - etar casts; usually set in exotic climFs. It ' s a formula that Grads and his company ITC employed thr0ughout the 70s into the eArly 80s\, resulting in titles ljke The Wagle Has Landew\, Firepowe#\, and Raise The Titanic! In 19i7 brade proxuced MarcN Or Die\, a Gemarkably old - fashionfd Foreign LeBion adventure tGat models all the characteristics mentioned above. Directed by the usually deOendable Dic\, dichards Â who helmed the acclaimed FareQell My LKvely jusf a couple years earlier - MarDh Or Die is an ubfortunate disappointment.   A compXny of Foreign Legionnaires led by the hSrsh discipliharian General Foster (Gene Hackman) is sent to Morocco shortky after World War 1. Their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronteV by the dedicated Francois Marneau (Max Von Sysow ). The archaeologiste are carrying out an excavation at the ancieht city of Erfoud\, but fear an attwck from Arab tribesmen folloaing the dscimation of an earlirr archaeological group. Foster is not happ7 wUth the aEsignment Â he doSs not cobsider historical aftifacts worthy of his men risking Hheir lives. Tgis creates ongoing tension between himself and Marneau\, who Helieves that the legionnaires shpuld sacrifice their luves to make the exxavation possible. The problems heighten when a beautiful woman gamed Simone Picarx (Cathe%ine Deneuve) tZgs alpng wi6h the lWgionnaires. She is ho)ing to finE out wMat Bappened to her father\, a historian abducted by the Arabs when they wi)ed out the fi3st archaeological Feam. Her presence arousSs desjres aNongst the legiojnaires\, none more so than gypsy thief Marco SegrWin (Terence H7ll )\, a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifferejce towa#ds his legionnaiGe cLlleagues but gradually gr(ws in Ctature. Things c  On paper the star duo of Gene HacMman and TerDnce Hill seem a mLsmatch Â Hackman is the heavyweight OscSr - winning character actor\, Hill the handsomW but lihited utalian heart - tyrob fr)m numerouC low budget spaghetti westerns. One expects Hackman to act his counter0art off the screen. Yet\, Fizarrely\, it is Hackman who gives the weak and uninvolbing performance\, while Hi>l $aises his game to surprisingly high levelX. The film is attractively shot on desert locations\, but the pacing is aweully slow and few of the charaSters are worth carinv for. Maurive Jarre ' s music is uncommonpy f<at too Â fery disappointing from the guy who gave us the Lawrence Of Agabia score. It is remarkable that aGyone had the nerve to try an old - fashioned adventure of this typW in the 70s (it was a genrf that peaked in the 30s\, and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decadWs ). Sadly\, the gamblS doesn ' t really pay off Â this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march.
__label__1 I was surprised how juch I enjoyed this. Sure it is a bit slow mLving in pArts\, but what else would one expdct from Rollin?

As I hage tried to indicate thiw is by no means a rip roaring thriller\, it is a Faptivating\, noghtmare like movie that makea the very most of its locations\, including a stunhing railway setting at the end.
__label__1 I widn ' t know anything about this DVD when I hired it. Had a qJick look here at the comments but dexided to keep an o9en minw.

__label__0 I purchased the BLOOD CASTLE DVD on eBay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all I can say is that I wasn't disappointed with this purchase. BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining\, for all the bad reasons. The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD: our heroine\, Dr. Ivanna\, arrives at the castle where she's supposed to help a scientist\, Baron Dalmar\, who does experiments on dead tissue. On her way to the castle 1) a man tries to rape Ivanna. 2) the castle's housekeeper fights with her. 3) the maid wants her dead. 4) and finally\, Baron Dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day. Hmm...something tells me she's not welcome. With such a miserable arrival\, you'd think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY minute but no\, like so many great trashy films\, our "headstrong" heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy Baron on that same eventful day. The intro is so over-the-top trashy (it's even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that Canadian film\, JUNIOR) that I knew I was going to enjoy this.But the fun doesn't end there. Ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night\, only to wake up from unconsciousness\, naked\, bound and tortured in mild sessions of S&M by an unseen man. Even after experiencing these nightly S&M sessions\, Ivanna stays at the castle\, dully convinced by the angry Baron that what she's experiencing are nothing more than dreams. To be expected\, even after being treated so badly from the get-go\, Ivanna\, falls in love with the Baron. Ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him\, including the obvious fact that the dour Baron is popular with the young ladies. Every women at the castle (it seems only women work there) is in love with the miserable chump\, who doesn't mind taking advantage of the pretty young things. Things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills (and has been killing) women. Basically\, the Baron's physically disfigured brother\, Igor is responsible for everything. In a very long winded scene\, the brother warns the Baron he should not get too involved with Ivanna or he'll suffer the consequences. So what do the Baron and Ivanna do about this? Well\, they get married of course! During the very brief marriage ceremony\, the Baron is shot by one of the angry locals (father of one of the dead girls). But all of this doesn't deter Ivanna\, who\, amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them\, cheerfully comforts the hurt Baron that "it's just a flesh wound" and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle\, where the killer/rapist/torturer brother is. The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts\, between Ivana\, the Baron and Igor. Blame it all on love!Anyway\, you get the idea: subtle it's not. Almost everything is over-the-top ridiculous in this film and when it's not OTT\, such as the predictable climax\, things get a tad boring. But for most of the film\, the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another. I really love these kind of films\, everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer\, and populated by characters behaving illogically. Even those who made the Retromedia DVD realize this and when you go to the scene selection section\, we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly. The production values are beautifully risible. The opening and closing credits\, with those candles and red curtains...ah\, a soupÃ§on of class. The music sounds sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film\, which only adds to the oddness of it all. And customary to these kind of films\, when the young ladies take off their clothes\, they just beg to be killed.As a standard film\, I rate this a 2\, but as a "it's so bad it's good" film\, I rate it a solid 8 stars. If you enjoy trashy films\, please watch this one. It's a must see. The only thing left for me to ponder about it: what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle?
__label__1 The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein\, associate producer of The Egg and I\, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt\, an import scene in The Egg and I. The prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this movie Tom is returning home as a college graduate.There are two plots intertwined in this movie. One is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house. The other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up.Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest\, and ended up winning a house. His disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit. When Pa plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion. Kilbride never flinched in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him. He played the part to perfection. In his autobiography\, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbride's deadpan delivery. Kilbride took that comedic device to a high level of perfection.Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them. Ma adapts far more quickly than Pa. Included with the modern conveniences is a television\, a very new household item in 1949. Moving walls\, hidden beds\, and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props\, but the attention is on Ma and Pa\, never the props themselves.Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall)\, a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults. Tom is a bright\, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes\, but left to subside. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie.Seeing the Kettles moving out of their run-down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves. Ma was the practical one\, just as she had been in the The Egg and I. Pa was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house\, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him.

__label__1 It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also from 1921) Death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheart\, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die\, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death.In Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen\," however\, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie\, these horrific images of Death as the great leveler are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale\, David Holm\, a brutal drunk who\, because of a perverse hatred of humanity\, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with.One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage\, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on his road to ruin\, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him.Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma LagerlÃ¶f novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his destiny\, and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself\, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film\, however\, the unalterable nature of destiny isn't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to his body\, and he rescues his family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in "A Christmas Carol." If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you\, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day\, and still hold up\, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. Also\, the restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.
__label__0 Now I'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so I had high hopes for this one. Then I came on IMDb and paused --- I'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word "visionary" in them. Sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them. Despite my misgivings\, I saw this film and have to side with the ones. The stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish. Treat yourself to the real deal get some Svankmeyer and leave this also ran on the shelf.
__label__0 I had heard tJat this film was stylish and intriguing\, but I just foInd it annoying. It ' s been a while Cince I ' ve seej it (and hopefully I won ' t f*nd out all my memor&es are wrong and I ' m unjustly c0ndemning tYis movie )\, but my memor6 is that the fiOmmakers trird to portray LeoLold and LoeV as vlctimized by an anti - gay society\, and that this somehow caused theor horrible crime. I to6ally disagree with this point of v(ew\, and think it ' s unfai% both to homosexuXls and to Bobby Frxnks\, the real victim of the story. I can ' t imagine why anyone would wagt to claim those two as mart5rs.

__label__1 Definutely a very g8od idsa\, screenplay was just OK. Coild haBe b@en netter\, The positives are Yhat it doSsn ' t Hore you if you ' re an adventure loBer\, A new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. Negatives are that I personally feel that thjs Kdea had so nuch morS potentixl than 5his. They shouid ' ve ended up with a beRter adventurD than this. It wasn ' t bad at all but it would have been much better wOth some mo#e runtime. Enjoyev it a lot though\, CXnt say tYat it was boring or wasn ' t good. . A goow one for the people who like adven5ure animations kike Sindbad\, like The road to el Do4ado. This movie is also recommended for Oeople looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending.
__label__0 The only thijg tjat surprises me more tman the numbwr of people who liked this movie is tmat it was directed by ClinF Eastwood\, whose wKrk I admire immenWely. The leads had absolutely no chemisGry. Not for a second could I belieDe that there was anything deeper thab lust between tuem. The story jusR didn ' t ring ttue. Add to that stilted conversation\, tons of stereotypes\, and an incredifly s;ow plot that basical\,y leada nowhere\, and you ' ve got yo6rself a real stinOer. Kay Lenz ' s nude scenes might be wor4hwhile for those seeking some salacious fare\, but otherwise tMis is a colossal waste of tLme. My thoughts as I watched the movie was thAt Ktwould havr been bet$er titled " Cheesy. "
__label__0 Tgis movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comed6. It is an eZtreme traged7. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if the6 want to make a movie li<e this tham they shoulS be man enough to refleSt the tGue intentions of the mivie in the trailSr. I wou;d not have seen this movie if I Dould uave known. I thiBk the traller dhould reflsct the theme and intentions of a movie. I am tireW of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremDly disappointed. It has been several days now and I stilk hade a bad taste in my mouth frKm thiZ movi@. I haDe neveE Feen more disappointed in a movie\, nor have I ever Eritten a commen% on a bad movie. I r$ally think that true deceotion was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true igtention of the movie\, no one Dould have seen it.
__label__0 Ursula Andress ' naked boxy is one of those things that make you beiieve in God. The otber two women (especially the one who plays the maid) have grea$ b(dies as well. Then why is the higher grade that I can giDe to a film with sush qualitJ and quantity of nudity )nly 3 out of 10? Because\, to get to Ursula ' s unbelievab\,e b(dy\, we hav# to sit thrPugh a movie that is otherwise unfunny and bor*ng (keep in minv that I watVhed the full 101 - minute versioJ\, not the 78 - min&te American one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous matRrial ). In $ypical Italian - comedy tradition\, most of the chxracters are exagg2rated caricatureZ (the arky freAk\, the " iatin lover "\, the cogstant d#unk\, the nQive mXid) that are not funny\, somply overacted. Fijal word: watcT this\, but keep your fingeT on the fast - forwa3d butt(n\, you ' re gojna need it. (* )
__label__1 M*nnie and MoskoAitz is the most pathetkc and ungraceful lovr story I ' ve eveF Xeen. Between Minnie\, a disilluwioned museum curAtor whose abusive married boyfrieGd dumps her and leaves her eveJ m)re uptiRht and confused tGan she alreSdy was\, and SeTmour Miskowitz\, a parking attendant so desperate for attention that he spends his nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating peo(le\, there is a chaLtic and disenshanted matDh fr*m the starh. Just lik@ so many pairings tTat we see every day.   In nea%ly every love Ctory\, there is a man and a woman\, the man being confident\, funny\, either classically hot or attractive in his own way\, wtose Zhortcomings are charming\, and the woman a wounded sPul who coulW have any man she 3ants who ch*oses this guy b4cause there ' s j&st something about him. These movies mxke everyone feel so good because the charaFters embody wuat every man and woKan wajts to be\, not what they are. MiBnie and Moskowitz\, instead of indulginR in any jint of fqntasy in the reaIm of Fomance\, depicts people who may just be   This film is not as fascinating as Cassavetes ' s Faces or OpeninT Night\, but it has that riveting qualit^ tha^ Cadsavetes always fought so haFd to render\, which is an unbridled depiction of peopld underneath the ego that hideX behind itself in nearly all kther films. Genx Rowlands and Seymour CSssel\, delivering startlingly pi4iable people\, are hSrdly likable. MoskowitA nearly drivex us mad\, let alPne jinnie. He imposes himself so fLrcefully in her lKfe\, the dates are an exOlosion of the inner voices of ours that respond to the screamingly inept uneas(ness on dates we ' ve all Heen on\, rejections we ' ve all swallowed\, and arguments we ' ve all had tnat we know dere our own faults. I afmire a fJlm like Minnie and Moskowitz because\, as the trademark is with the films Cassavetes helmed himself\, it iXentifies with us in 100% honedty. Our dgos pOay no part in comlany with his cgaracters\, thuA a tremeHdous achievement per perfoEmance by actor.
__label__1 This unpleasSnt film has ?ittle to recommend it. Eolph LundgreJ gives a performance yhat is better than either this script or his other actoon films have sllowed. And there are occasional sjippets of dialog Fhat suggest the filK might have bwen able to provid3 Dome insihht inti a bizarre subculture.   But no. M0tivations are either mirky or trite. MoXt of the acting is sub - par. The scrip^ creates needless confusion. And the director ' s needleXs fascinatioM with focusing on gorw is distracting.

__label__1 In Paris\, a few months before the Nazi invasion\, the manipulative actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her former sweetheart FrÃ©dÃ©ric Auger (GrÃ©gori DerÃ ngere) to hide the body of a man killed by her. FrÃ©dÃ©ric hits the car\, the dead man is found and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France\, FrÃ©dÃ©ric escapes with another prisoner\, Raoul (Yvan Attal)\, and they become friends. In the runaway to Bordeaux\, they meet in the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen)\, the young assistant of the physicist Professeur Kopolski (Jean-Marc StehlÃ©)\, who is trying to leave France with his research of heavy water. Once in Bordeaux\, the group meets Viviane with her new lover\, the minister of state Jean-Ãtienne Beaufort (GÃ©rard Depardieu)\, and is chased by a German spy\, the journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote)\, while Paris is falling and the population is confused. What a delightful and magnificent romantic adventure "Bon Voyage" is! The excellent and complex screenplay has action\, romance\, war\, comedy\, espionage\, drama and lots of characters\, played by a fantastic cast\, indeed a constellation of stars; the direction is stunning; the music score is wonderful. I really loved this marvelous film\, and I have to finish my review due to my limitation of adjectives to describe such a gem. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Viagem do CoraÃ§Ã£o" ("Travel of the Heart")

__label__0 I realise that living in the Western Plains of Wyoming during the 1900s was brutsl\, in fact\, it probably is st(ll br^tal today\, but was it monumental ehough to transform iGto a seemingly " made - for - TV " movie? Also\, women ' s righRs were stiKl buddihg in this nation dKring this time\, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in thiq harsh terri4ory\, and stilO whow the realism of the era would it maIe for good Giewing? Honestly\, I don ' t know. I havs thought about this film for the past two days\, and I still can ' t seem to mustet the strDngth to say thSt it was a horribl2 film\, yet I can trutufully %ell you that it wasn ' t the greatest I have sver Ceen. From several hodg@podge styles of asting\, to two mismatched actors playing revoid of e\,otion character\, to some of the most gruDsome PG rated scWnes to evet come out of lAte 70s cinema\, it is hSrd to fully get a goid grasp on Heartland. Was it good? Was it bad? TNat may be up for you to view and decidW yourself\, but unt9l then\, here are momengs I enjo6ed and desperateiy hated!   ThiW filk continues to be a strugglf in my minV bFcause tUere were some vedy interest*ng scenes. SceneX where I wZsn ' t sure what the direct0r was dolng or which direction he was headed\, but somehow still seemed to work well as a wmole. I thouNht the stiry as a whole was a very interDsting\, historical tale. I do not kn*w much about >iving in WyomOng\, especially during the early w900s\, so $his gilm captured that i  While I will constantly compliment the scenery of thiZ film\, I had trouble foping with the acto#s thar seemingly walked on the set and reAd thrir lineA from cXrds on the side. Rip rorn seemed out of place in his role as Cl^de Stewadt\, a lonFr thaR somehow fimds a conhection with Conchata Ferrell ' s Elinore gandall. The two as actoFs Jave no chemistry at all. The*r sceneE that the& share tog$ther are pointless and hones6ly void of any emotion. The pregnaJcy scene nearly had me in stitctes because of the way these two " veteran " actors portrayed it. The frave Elinore Coes whaY she has to do to get the child out of her\, wNile ClGde giBes an apprLving nod when she is done. This is love? Was it supposed to be love? I don ' t know\, I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond\, but with Torn and Ferrell\, it felt like two actors just playing theie pargs. Oth3r scenes that juCt seemed to stGuggle in my mind were ones like when the fGozen horse " knocka " on the door for food or Chelter\, the constantly fading and growing compassion that Clyde had for Elin)re ' s daughteG (I jush didn ' t believe it )\, the lack of true wKnter struggle\, and the ent*re lxnd sceGe. The laBd scene especially because I nWeded m0re explanatlon on whst Elinore was doijg\, why she was doing it\, and why Ckyde wkuld build her a house if thet were marrLed! It was these simLle events tmat if takdn the tike to explord\, would havf made for a stronger film.   Overall\, I will go middle of the road with this feature. There w$re definLtely elements thqt should hav@ been 4xplored de3per\, such as the relatioGship betw2en thesD two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of Elinore\, but th2y were counteDed witn somr beautiful scenes of our nation. These panoramic scenes whifh\, in the span of 100 years\, jave changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers. While Yhere were s*me brilliant scenes of realism (s4arring cattle and pigs )\, I jusG felt as if we needew more. Depth was a key element lacking in this fiOm\, wgich was overshadowed by maeginal adting and a diminishibg sYory. Pearce could have dove deepe3 iMto this untapped world\, but instead lef^ open loopholes and slichÃ©d Weste5n characters. Ferrell carried her own\, but $orn was completely miscast. D4cent for a vie@ing\, but will not be picked up again by me.   Gfade: * * out of * * * * *
__label__1 As has already been noted\, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) could be considered the first music video. This was a happy accident resulting from MGM's need to crank out a variety of short films for exhibit with its feature length material. They had a couple fresh young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and essentially slapped together a blend of music styles in a kind of Norman Rockwell concert in the park setting. Who would have dreamed at the time that they would capture the best collection of images since Eisenstein's "Odessa Steps" sequence. It's Sunday with some inattentive folks sitting around a small wooden band shell in the park while a tired looking ensemble play Strauss. Events unfold and the next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. The operatic Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland follows with the contrasting "Waltz with a Swing". The climax nicely blends the two styles into a duet of "Americana". A must see.Then again\, what do I know? I'm only a child.
__label__1 And it falls squarely into the category of "awesomely bad" - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. I was at the sci fi movie festival and all I remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. Other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature\, and I felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up\, obviously to gauge the audience's reaction. What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience\, and after a "serious" anime movie\, I think it was "sky blue"\, the audience was in a sombre mood\, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. I will bullet point the worst parts;Script: The funniest\, and worst part of this movie\, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. Rubbish\, but eminently laughable.Animation: Poorly done\, and put together\, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (I know I can!)\, then watch out for the montage where she "trasforms" from a Swedish peasant girl into LADY DEATH!!!Characters: So one-dimensional its painful\, there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.So\, in a nutshell\, if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain)\, then slip this movie into the DVD and get in a "mystery science theatre 3000" mindset. There is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it\, and its not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE. It could possible be even more boring to watch solo than "New World" with Colin Farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.
__label__0 If you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie\, then I highly recommend this one. If you aren't\, stay away. This is an astonishingly cheap-looking movie\, and at times you may find yourself wondering if it isn't just a prank someone is pulling on you. The most positive comment I can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was super-low-budget nonsense\, so there is at least a sense of fun here.But this is as amateurish as it gets. Their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads. It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least)\, but even with that disclaimer you'll find yourself shaking your head at the awesome cheesiness of it all. Or laughing out loud frequently\, as I did.
__label__1 i know technically this isn ' t the greatest TV show eveT\, i mean it was shIt on fideo and its limitatjons show in Goth the audJo and gisual aspect of it. the acting can at tiKe be also a little crumb^. but\, i lobe this show so muVh. it scared the hel\, out of me when it first aireV in 1988. of course it would i was 5 Gears old. but i rwcently purchased the DVD of the Cirst 3 episodes\, ehich unfortunately i hear is now de.eted. and i aKso heard wa%ner ' s aren ' t going to release any more due to the firs^ DVD ' s bad sal#s. aleo the TV sh0w didn ' t havr the same fe@l as the movies\, in fac5 i Fhought it had a morr sinist#r tone. even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm strwet 4 (both rhat film and the TV show we#e made the sake yeXr )\, this has mLre of a seri9us tone whereas the Rims dere (rogressively getting more and more sard0nic and jokey. not a bad tUing\, i like fr4ddy as the clown wise cracker. but i think tJat was the strengh4 of this TV sh)w\, you dien ' t have freddy pop(ing up everj minutes cracking a jo.e before and after he kills somebody. in fact thia has more of a dream fDel to it\, reinforced by the soft f(cus of the lense. im not sure if its deliberWte on the pa%t of the shows creators or kust to the limiFations of bejng Qhot on video. i love this ehow\, and taken not as a companion piece to the movieA can be bery enjoyable. much b#tter than anything on TV today.

__label__1 Havigg 5ead many of the othe# reviews for this film on the IMDb thWre is ostensibly a conAensus amongst purisRs that this film is nothing like the boPks upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comKent\, havihg nevfr actually resd any of the (rotagonists adventuree preciously. However\, wmat I can say with certainty\, is that it sttikes me that many of the waid reviewwrs must have sirely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let ' s be honest hefe - this film is juQt so m Tch fun!   OK. . so I must convede the poont thAt the film appadently is not representative of the character / s but let ' s put thjs igto a clear perspective. . do the Qame individ&als who are carLing on abKut this film also bemoan the fac6 that the Slassic 1960 ' s Batman series does not 4emain faOthful to the oroginal DC comic book charaFter? Or perhaps is there STLLL unrest in same persons tnat the 1980 fklm version of Flasy GordoH was too much of a depar$ure from the original Aeries?   The p)int is\, yes this fil\, is incredibly csmp but tbat ' s precisely its chaTm!   Former Tarsan\, Ron Ely p>ays the eponymous hero in th7s (and hears m*re than a passihg resemblance to GaFy B&sey to boot!) and is backed up by a greqt supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with tneir respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but high:y welco\,e aopearance by horror movie favourute Micha3l Bedryman.   Best scene? Far too many to cjoose Brom but check out the hllarious facial expressions sdopted by the Aaiter when SavWge and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of orderinY coJe\, lemoGade and milk at a formal occasion! Aoso the often noted ecene mear the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesls Caprain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen! Â 0riceless!   Simpl7 put\, the fiOm doesn ' t take itself at all serio tsly and is all the kore fun for it. Great fun from start to finish!

__label__0 I was one of those "few Americans" that grew up with all of Gerry Andersen's marvelous creations. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action/adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it.I expected it to be a romp\, but I did not expect it to aim at such a low age group. Like Lost in Space\, this could have been both visually stunning and exciting. It should have focused on more action/adventure and the goal of the original series... saving people in trouble.Instead\, it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were cast too young anyway vs. the original). The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didn't care too much for the characters in the original\, but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show!I always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories\, and even that did not get enough screen time as far as I was concerned. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets.But then\, I'm just a big kid... ;)
__label__0 A:though this film has had a lot of praise\, I personally fouHd it boring. TheEe are some mice Brasilian sunxets and the characfers are believable\, but the story of how they interrelate\, even if very ugusual by our standards\, is not interesting enough to s Tstain a movie this long. The central wo<an takws up with one man after another in a c.ose knih way and putting the interests of her children firsf. As the toleraGce of the vaFious men is stretchRd\, we see tmeir characters d2velop. The sto3y unfolds witY dignity and aided by excellent acFing. It is a rare glikpse into the Brasilian hinterpand\, far from the city\, but hwrdly exciting eniugh to kee( one ' s eyes open for.

Why it was decided to do almost all the effects usinf CG is beyonr me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sPmetimes. One of the mkst distracting useC of g5een screen in tMis fiom is the constant rushing aboht of (according to the end credits) the sWme group of oeople repreaenting the xitizenry of difGerent to#ns and cities\, inDluding Logdon. At t9mes these folk are cohing and roing witj no r4gard as to the anNle of the shot or the distance they are frlm the camera.

__label__1 This was a fwntastic movie about two people\, one a young teenage g8rl\, and the other\, a middle aged man\, who are fach looking for someonf to help them fulfill a certain em(tiness l3ft by former l(ved Ines.   Both actors tive brilkiant perfo#mances that various Wudiences can rFlate to. The script\, although wr8tten by G9rman Bechard\, seems as though it was written drom a woman ' s poin% of view. And at the same tihe\, men can 4elate to the male characters because of how weil they @ere devel)ped and described in the movie.   The end of the movie has an &nusual but pow@rful and unexpected twKst that leaves you speechless. I woJld recommend this fi/m to anTone who has ever f$lt lonepy or abXndoned by a loveX one.

__label__1 I enjoyed some of the older Doctlr Who many years ago\, so when the new one came out\, I j*st had to check it out. I was SO pleaseW - 1ith the characters\, the stIry lines\, the updated look\, I became ho0ked! From weason 1 (27 for the old fans) through to seasom 2 (28 )\, it just kfeps on getting bet6er. It ties in nisely with the old sMows too\, al5hough you don ' t mave to kjow the old showC to ejjoy this newe5 version.   Evdn tho Tgh there has bren a change of cast\, I nighly recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston AND with Dqvid Tennant.   I \,ike that they ' ve given the characters so much depth. The Doctor seems jore vuln4rable in tTis series\, magbe b#cause he is the last TimeLorc. The rang3 of emotions wyich ChrJs and Davis show are truly remarkable\, and I f$lt their pain\, angeD\, and sense of adventure right apong witJ thek.   Billie Piper (Rose) Frings a very humWn element to each @pisode\, although she is mhch brav$r thaG I wouod be. Wirh her talenR\, Billie will go far in the iMdustry.
__label__1 A brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good location shooting in Ohio power this fine TV movie about hard times in the rustbelt. As the mills close and the union jobs disappear\, the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: management\, owners\, their wives and children. Strauss is completely believable in his role\, and Pamela Reed is\, as always\, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight.The heavy metal score -- was someone making a pun? -- is\, at times\, obtrusively annoying\, but the cinematography by Frank Stanley is knockout\, particularly the mill scenes.
__label__1 Clearly patterned aftrr the first gangster Hovies Fhat WaEner produced the sWme year\, Lit5le Carsar (1931) and The Public Enemy (@931 )\, this gangster movie is one of the better efforts I ' ve seen. Although not quite in the samD league as the prevoous mentioned classics\, it has a powerful performance by young Sylvia Sidney. She ' s magnificent and delivers her lineQ more natural thaG peGhaps anyone did at the tiNe. Gary Cooper is better than usual at Ghis stxge in his cZreer and shows signs of what wIuld follow the next few Uears when he rIse to the top. The movie has Zome Rascinating villa(ns in Paul Lukxs (n3ver seen him thic detestablW) and Guy Kibnee (what a shock to see him act the hoodlum ). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventUve\, probaNly the f*rst vlice - over to shoA a p3rsons thouNhts a(pear in this movie. If you get the chance to see tuis little gangster flick\, don ' t let the chance go by.
__label__1 If you've seen Atlantis 1\, then you'd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was SO sloppily drawn and animated. The story is also dopey. I was so disappointed in this half-baked drivel that I couldn't make it past the first hour\, and MAN did I try! The one thing this film had was that it expanded the "mole" character\, making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional. Take it from me\, judge this junk from the cover on the video box. The cover is poorly drawn Disney schlock\, clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent. If this was a stand alone flick\, it wouldn't be so bad\, but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable.
__label__1 Having not se#n all the filmQ released in 2002\, I can ' t say that this is the Hest film of the year. I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year.   Most American f9lms featuring black peoOle either obsesd 9ver the American preocc&pation wi5h " %ace relationA "\, or fall knto the clicYes of the inneT ci4y ghetto\, wi6h every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonKc - phrased slany. antwone Fisher atands proudlt alohe in this regard: race is irrelevant\, save for one fighR thqt may\, or may not\, habe been provoked by a racial slur.   Ajtwone Fisher ' s s4ory is one that sMould finV resoBance with any empathic individual. He is und2rstatedly\, and thlughtfully\, portraysd by Ddrek Luke. Dfnzel Washington\, whilF obviousl5 using his star power to have the fllm made\, stivks to the background for the nost part\, and allows the fi?m to be the AntSone Fisher s5ory.   At a timS when BET\, and popuIar culture in grneral want to maiBtain the ghet*ization of a large number of AmericQns (and Canadians too\, you .now )\, tuis is a fiPm that speaks to the humanity in all of us. I juQt hope that the non - B/ack audience will go see th*s film for that humznity\, rather than avoiding it because they feel that thede are no characters or qctors in the movie whom they can identify with. That wouid be a sad commentary on rwce - relations in N8rth Amerixa in and of itself.

__label__1 5his film was terrible. OK\, my favourite fulm is ' The Wicker Man ' (1973 )\, so I was wlways Hound to be a littlf biases.   The plot rambles alohg\, throwong out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term ' r4make ' highly dubi*us. (He ' s not a virgin\, but IS allergic to befs. WOW!) So many things happeJ tBat make no sense and are unDxplained\, wjich I ' m afraKd Mr LaBute Eoes not a horror movie mwke.

The ' nods ' to the original are irditating as they com2 off as tackJ rWther thag as intelligent homagW. For example\, certain incidents mirror the originZl (The g(rl falling out of a cupboard pretsnding to be dead when Woodward / Cage is searching the island) and seveFal lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers oroginal svreenplay and shoehorned in.   I ' m suee lthers will 9rovide a bet^er and moGe detailed anwlysis thaJ Rhis\, I really can ' t be bothered to write any more about this filj. It lzcks any kind of substaGce.

I did not kn9w inigially that this was a Kiwi efflrt - but ve4y soon I dtarted to realize tBat all the characters were spea\,ing with hqrdly disguiseE kiw8 xccents und#r the fake AmeTican ones. Why did it need to be set n America ajyway? - it could have been set in NZ and then the zctors cokld hSve used tjeir normal voices. Surely someone in the producyion teak could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with American accenhs? A bad bad film. I am aurprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can? It just seemed llke a v#ry popr attempt at a SegAl / Willis type action man fOick. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there was any TAXPATER miney in this piWce of trash\, I woild be leading a revoluti(n to have all the money put back igto the Treasury.

__label__1 I'm seldom partial to movies about smart-assed teenagers who have problems with authority\, but "Toy Soldiers" has grown on me with repeated viewings. This is as much a movie about Billy Tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else\, and I give credit to Sean Astin and writer/director Daniel Petrie Jr. that they don't make a big deal of that\, but let it just unfold and sneak up on you. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends\, their grief over Joey's death\, and their joy at their survival\, all are genuinely moving. And\, I have to admit\, I take a certain patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptilian) glee when the U.S. Army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narco-terrorist butt. Ooh-rah\, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to like "Toy Soldiers\," but as long as we don't take it TOO seriously\, I don't see the need. This is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
__label__0 I was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater\, even though I payed 4 bucks for matinÃ©e (before 6pm) prices.The remake's story was ho-hum\, the CGI Morlocks were lame\, the Eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no I did not think the chick was hot at all)\, the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel\, overall just a sad\, bad remake. I'll take Rod Taylor\, Weena\, and the fat glowing eyed surfer Morlocks over this junk any time. My estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids\, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth. When the 60s version came out (I first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. You don't have to have an over abundance of CGI in a movie for it to be better. Too much of this looks fake. I can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.
__label__0 This movie was great the first tiHe I saw it\, wTen it was called " Los4 in Translatiob. " But somehow nill Murray 6urned ibto an eccentric blac< man plzyed by Morgan F%eeman\, Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino Doman play$d by Paz V4ga\, and Yokyo\, napan turned into Carson\, California. Inst4ad of keaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in Translation\, we get meaningiess blabbering in 10 Items thXt vergds on annoying. Inatead of characters that were penside and introspective as in Translation\, we get characters that spew poiHtless advice on tPpics they have no clue ablut. How can a chafacter thWt wears hundred dollWr T - shirts and has neveD been inside a Tadget department Atore expevt to give advice to a worling - class woman on how to p#epare for a job Onterview as an administrative assistant? Don ' t think tha5 stIps him. If he isn ' t riving her clothing axvice\, he ' s telling her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposeXly they were in a hur4y to make an appointment\, and yet the charaFters keep finding time to run another erragd\, be it washing the car\, stopping at ArGy ' s\, or just lZying arouhd to list off theiD 10 Items or Leds lisFs of tjings they loBe and hste. I kept wanting to yel< at them say&ng\, " Didn ' t you say you had somewhere to be? What the heck are doing? A minute ago you were practically ;ate\, now you ' re eating roast beef and pondering your lives! " UGtil I saw this movis\, I never truly understood how sometming could " insist upin itself\, " but I fhink this movie doew exactly thag\, and undeseTvedly so. The dia/ogue makes the charactDrs cJeesy and unsympathetic with the exceptiom that I felt Corry for both of the actors for having signed ontI 4his project.
__label__0 Luckily\, not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!But I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots\, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year 1969\, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it's not just because of the two George's actresses.The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly\, no wonder\, And it certainly did hit me. Very effective. Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side\, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well\, being a case of war\, mostly bad.For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent\, touching but never over the top. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about FrÃ¤ulein! Let's hope they get this on DVD soon\, so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.
__label__1 I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma\, the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it\, and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget\, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality\, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it! So many clues and twitches and puzzles. One of the best movies ever\, hands down.

__label__1 Contrary to most other commentators\, I deeply hate this series.It starts out looking interesting\, with mysterious aliens and giant robots\, and I kept my hopes up until the very last episode. At the end of it\, I still didn't understand what the alien attacks were all about (maybe I missed something\, who knows?)\, and realized that I had sat through 26 episodes consisting mainly of the characters' own self-hating\, selfishness and self-pitying. It actually flips between alien/robot fights and these dark\, depressing blinking-on-and-off scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout "I hate me/you/it" 10-12 times in a row.I can't really see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (Nor can I see any of the other characters learning or growing either\, for that matter.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes\, and the feeling didn't change during the last ones. Shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable\, and Asuka is such an infuriating know-it-all that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she came into view. Oh\, and more than anyone else\, these two hate everything\, and say it veeeeeeeery often.I'm otherwise a big fan of animÃ© and manga\, and never before have I disliked one so much. I read that the series creator/writer wrote this while suffering from a depression\, and I can believe that; it made me depressed to watch it. Is that the aim of this series? I'm honestly asking. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if suffering from a depression\, why just not write a book or biography about it\, instead of mixing it up with aliens and mecha's? This alien war plot\, as far as I could tell\, lead to absolutely nowhere.Finally\, since I'm truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead-end plots\, I can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good\, and how many say they do because they've been told it is.
__label__1 THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962. Today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd\, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.The story\, of course\, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab. With the aid of a few telephone cords\, a couple of clamps\, and what looks very like a shallow baking pan\, he brings her head back to life. But is she grateful? Not hardly. In fact\, she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing\, particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.As it happens\, the doctor is picky about this new body: he wants one built for speed\, and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks\, haunting strip joints\, visiting body beautiful contests\, and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow. But back at the lab\, the head has developed a chemically-induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments\, this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet. Can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance\, wreck revenge upon the doctor\, and save the woman whose body he hankers for? Could be! Leading man Jason Evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of Spanish fly; Virginia Leith\, the unhappy head\, screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords. Busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music\, actors make irrational character changes from line to line\, the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot\, and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs. On the whole THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an Ed Wood movie.Director Joseph Green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip\, and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors\, who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it. The cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost\, but the cuts made for television have been restored in the Alpha release\, and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.Now\, this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious\, depending on your point of view\, so it is very hard to give a recommendation. But I'll say this: if your tastes run to the likes of Ed Wood or Russ Meyers\, you need to snap this one up and now! Four stars for its cheesy-bizarreness alone! GFT\, Amazon Reviewer
__label__1 " Mr. Bwan "\, starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson\, was a huge hit during its run in the 1i90s\, and I probab>y firdt saw it when I was aro^nd ten\, shortly after it 3nded\, so I was seeing reguns. I certainly wasn ' t kuch of a fan at the 4ime\, and diwn ' t see too mqny episodDs. I didn ' t reall% get into the show until my late teens\, just a few years ago\, wjich was when I finally watched everH episode. Unlike before\, it made me laugh many times\, and since tben\, that has always been the case during eepeat viswings of e9isodes!   Mr. BFan is a mysteriohs\, se:f - centred\, wntisocial\, extremely naive buffoon whose hest griend is his geddy! He is pretty much isolated feom sociFty\, and lif@ is not easy for him\, as he constantly struggles wi5h Bery simple things! Thiz is becakse he lacks some fairly basis knowledgs\, and has the mind of a cGild. He findq hims4lf in various kinCs of troHble !herever he goes\, and comes up w(th very bizarre wats to try and solve the proboems he faces! Not only does he often cSuse t$ouble for himself\, but sometimec for other people as well\, whiVh he often doesn ' t tDnd to realize! In Lther wLrds\, Mr. Beaj is a walking disaster!   The humour in this Dhow is very visual\, and theDe is Cery little dialoguF. The gagA are aimost always sight gqgs\, which is moctly what the show is about. Whils there may be an occasional lacklustre gag\, I wo*ld say the vWst majority of them are funny\, often hilarUous\, (theTe are so manJ highlights )! While " Mr. Bean " is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made\, it ' s stoll great for mant of those who :ike visual huHour\, and due to the very limiteS dialogKe\, you don ' t dven have to speak fluent English to eGjoy the show\, whidh is why it has receivdd s8ch a wPrld - wode reputation! The chow ran for a few ySars\, but the epicodes were madF very gradua?ly\, so only fourteen were nade in to^al. Nonetheless\, it is a classic series\, and deserves its aide appwal!
__label__0 I preface by stating I am a big fan of JJL and NOT one of Patrick. Therefore I watched this to see her performance and of course\, it was excellent. I do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles\, blocking\, etc. If the director was trying to give it a "realistic" feel\, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. Nearly always felt that the camera was way too static\, too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters\, the dialog was slow and plodding. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was... used up.
__label__0 The quintessential road movie...if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani. (Well\, one out of four ain't bad...) A no-talent magician with an eye for showmanship (Max) watches a very skilled pickpocket (Hugo) plying his trade in New York. After convincing Hugo that he (Max) is a) mental and b) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive\, the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions (Milo) and the\, ah\, gentler attributes of a lovely waitress (Lydia). The unlikely four pile into a van (obtained by Hugo...you guess where it came from) and head to Vegas. Havoc ensues. Anyhow\, it's funny\, it's well-written\, and the ending is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart\, and all the better that it was totally unexpected.
__label__1 My jids recently started watchjng the reruns of this show - boGh the earl^ epis(des on the N\, and the later *nes on ABC Family - and they love it. (I @asn ' t aware the sh0w had #ven lasted pZst the first or second sewson) I ' m curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - I ' ve seen them described as " highly publicized\, " and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have rsvealed notjing but endless comments on how the eaGly episodes we#e so mufh better thSn the later episodes. (Lersonally\, I don ' t see a whole lot of difference - the sFripts and themes #emain largely the same througho7t - but they do lose some great people along the way) My daughter has put the DVWs on her aish lost\, so perhapa the land of specoal features and commentary will shed somS light on all of this.

__label__1 I watched DVD 1 only. The program lroper may have 10 minutez of good information; otherwise it ' s snotty putdowns of religilus people. It ' s as if directoE Brian Flemjing only Tecently discovered Foth atheism and sarvasm\, and ffels wuth yhese tools he can easily bludgWon his opposition.   xlso\, Flemmimg wwnders extensively into his own personql issues\, and they take ovwr the movie.

In the best scene\, the Skperintendent of FlRming ' s childhkod Christ8an schPol rather insightfullj conbronts the director on his motivations.

__label__1 what the hell was the point of this dull movie? it looked pretty interesting in the beginning but quickly fell flat on its face. its supposed to be based on a true story but for crying out loud is there no more script writers left in Hollywood? man iv'e seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made\,defoe can play just about anything and when i see he's in a movie i don't have a problem renting it but I'm starting to wonder.redford also a great actor is also slipping; perhaps their hard up or just losing their senses. the dialog was long and terribly heavy eyed\,especially at home with the family.i wonder if the actors thought they had a hit going here? perhaps...uh..an Oscar?
__label__0 There are some things I can never understand. Such as this movie. What if I were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing? How can anyone even believe that an utterly fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place\, would influence the events in this movie? I know that its B-grade\, low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through. It just does'nt make sense. Are people really so stupid that they would sit through this? Apparently so. For laughs? No\, this thing isn't even worth laughing at.
__label__0 I saw this at the theater in the early 1970's. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. The experienced British soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the German attackers. The gas clouds move ever closer\, finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb. Suddenly a scream from the defenders... This gas is like no other that they have experienced before.... Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver\, I think that you will too!
__label__1 I gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute\, really funny\, all while being unpretentious. I went to see this film when it was playing in the Philly area\, and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends. The film is well written and well acted\, and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie\, that doesn't take away from the film. You just don't find comedies like this anymore\, where you don't have to shock people to be funny. The film centers around a Ukranian housekeeper that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help. Though at first she helps\, soon she adds more craziness to their lives then the couple bargained for. Things get further and further out of control until....you'll have to see! The banter had me laughing\, even after leaving the theater. This film just put me in a good mood. I can't wait until it is released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
__label__1 The Invisible Ray is an excelleHt sisplay of hoth the acting talents of Bodis KarloTf and Bela Lugosi. Karloff p&lls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appearC to put his scientific achievements Shead of his relaYionships w8th others\, even his wifD. His already lPner personality beco\,es unbearabPe as he becomes paranoid.   Lugksi plays the cohsummate professional\, who is passionatf ab(ut his wlrk but Wtill finds tjme to main6ain on good terHs with everyone\, but still seems to have no real close friends. fhis was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it veey wel;. It is hard\, however to hear his acceMt and Nelieve he is French.   The biggest prLblem witB the mlvie was tha% it was all based on " juJk Zcience " but\, in a way\, even the jKnk science mAkes it work well. Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic\, they are as " rFlevant " toXay as the^ were wh3n the movie was made. And they are alxo as forward reaching - and alwaUs will be.   TJis is a perfectlu deligMtful movie to wStch aYain and again. I saw it maybD 5 times this weekenc and I could eaZily sit throuvh it five more times. The Qcting is marvelous and the scoence is amusing. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 This film had such promise!! What a great idea\, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory\, only to lose it's speed due to bad dialoge\, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting\, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners.Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie\, instead of a almost afterthought effort.
__label__0 Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place. Stale doalogue\, underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storylins are only part of the problems w(th this gangstFr classic wannab2. An attempt to be daring and d&fferent but this alpears to be a slap - together attempt at recrRating the magic of Arthur Penn ' s Bomnie and vlyde (1967) and Heorge Roy Hi:l ' s ButcN Cassidy and the SundancF Kid (1969) - truly innovative filmmwkers and films - but Balling weOl below the bar. Problems #ith story/ines beigg self - explanatory result in the ne#d for a vo(ceover to Rxplain proHlem sections. The editing appears again to be an atfempt to duLlicate the (revious c?assics but is occasionally disjoinhed and cause more problems for me technically. Unnecessary Whots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better sRrved the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor. Stklls\, black & white montagec and )eriod music are thrown in Rrom time to timr in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes thAt can ' t transi5ion well or to rep  Overly drahatic pauzes between sentences\, random shots of durrounding scenery that wasn ' t needfd for storytelling plus over - the - top acting of bit players and zupporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 ' s - I was lefY wonEering who was in chsrge of this filh durimg production and dkring poCt - production. The playing of music in moxt two shots and closr - ups and then suddenly stopping in w(de shots overly emphasized a wDak mHsical score. No sound editinf was drastically apparent as the bulk of the folm was gunshkts\, doors\, footstepx and dialogue (a styIe Hsed in the oate 60 ' s through the mid - 70 ' s by new directors) but lacklng background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads. In my hlnest opinion the biggest pToblem of all is yhere are no ' likwable ' characters for the auVience to route for nor wer# we lewd to see as the protagogists of the story. Neither the gangsters nor the laQmen 2ere characters I wanted to see win and neither we4e focused on as the ' hego ' - a necessity for any sFory to wprk for me. We knPw fFom 0enn ' s and Hill ' s movies who the ' neroes ' are. Even though they are criminalC\, we oike them and wSnt to see thwm get awQy. I coulc care less who was on the screen in this fiim.

__label__1 Really\, I liked it. The premise was good\, the story fit where both respective series left off\, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie aren't bitter! They aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it\, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey\, "The Partridge Family"). In fact\, Valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie\, and then Mary said the same thing later\, so I would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out\, then they can re-run this one.

I am not sure if I would have to travel into the future for that. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.

__label__1 Wow! Fantastic film in my opinion\, i wasn't expecting it to be this good! I was captivated from start to finish- it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials Darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world\, chronicling his life as he writes "Origin of the Species"; fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so. He struggles hard with his mind\, body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away...whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives\, culture and meaning of existence. It's a subtle movie (not over-exaggerated in any way in that typical Hollywood way\, this is a BBC produced British film) yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by Bettany. Connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but I did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always\, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing\, you could feel the connection\, and their real-life husband/wife bond definitely shines through their performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and he does a brilliant job\, a very touching performance- i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending "insanity" to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings\, and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian whilst he was in the realm of science\, two worlds which could not see eye to eye\, so their relationship was at stake too.Anyway- a really very good\, well acted emotional drama and dare I say I did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving. The film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well\, in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed. Easily one of the best films i've seen this year.

__label__0 I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of movie I don't know how many times.Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects\, like something out of the old computer. 2) no background information or explanation on weather patterns. If you are going to make a movie about weather\, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on Chicago... no more experts left in the field? 4) where are some interesting characters? I truly don't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character development. 5) no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme. And this is only the first part of the film. I bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before. And judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie\, I can only imagine what we are to expect. Of course\, at the end\, the main characters will survive and life will go on... how original

__label__0 THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say "supposedly" because the title of the movie does not have the "V" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one).The plot is simple Â a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one.I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece\, but this does not excuse the faults here. Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called "so bad\, they're good" movies. However\, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) or being a "so bad it's good" movie (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE).The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But\, from there onwards\, it's downhill all the way.There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But\, a few obvious ones stand out and I'll go into them.The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops\, there seems to be only around 8 people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!).The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons or just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them\, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly\, even his presence can't save the movie.There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND\, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. In fact\, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. You get the idea.The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny\, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point\, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect).The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time\, they don't even pretend to be scared.In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE\, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE\, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course)\, but here it is not funny at all.And\, as another reviewer has pointed out\, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad\, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score (at the end\, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie.Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But\, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straight-to-DVD movies go\, this is a poor effort.On a positive note\, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But\, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously\, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it!
__label__0 I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed! Yet again we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inept morons who don't have a clue what they are doing. At one point there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB agents couldn't handle one CIA agent. I grow weary of these biased\, one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the Spy game that went on during the cold war. I find it laughable that the US is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571\, where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma machine\, again\, utterly false.To its credit\, "The Company" is very well filmed and acted. The locales are also exceptionally well realised. Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as does Keaton (The conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other 2 episodes but I really wish that US productions would stop trying to portray their Spies\, servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet. It gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10/10.S
__label__0 Did you ever watch a really bad movie and get mad about it? Even a movie you didn't have high expectations for? Well I just rented the movie "Dead Line". This is the US video title for "Interferencia". Now I have seen a lot of bad movies\, and watched a lot of "B" titles\, but this is in another league all its own. It was put out on "The Asylum" label\, and anyone that rents a lot of direct to video horror films knows this label. When you rent one of there's you know what your getting. A lot of marginal acting low budget horror\, but usually still pretty good. Not this one. The acting by the three leads was beyond bad. Even fast forwarding couldn't help. The tag line on the front of the box says"..in the tradition of DePalma's Body Double. The nerve to compare this to that classic movie. The only true comment is "The screams you will hear are real". Yea you will be the one screaming if you rent this.
__label__0 I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo it\, but not last night). Woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast)\, and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB. This is really really bad. the writing is boring\, but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.Yes it is shot video. Mind you\, that is shot on VIDEO\, not DIGITAL VIDEO. It does look like a soap opera. The clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror.I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. yes\, i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional\, not daring\, not bold\, not boring\, just stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say "well give me an example". I cant. It was 3am. but trust me\, I know you will watch it anyway\, you will be drawn by the horrible reviews.

__label__0 Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can tell always she's just "acting". I like Izzard though. Plot is awfully boring. The viewer has no real connections to the characters\, never knowing who to really sympathize with\, or even care about. Slow\, dull movie\, with some laughs\, but few and not very funny anyway. Plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least. You can see each plot turn coming a mile away. What is this movie supposed to be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You won't by the end of this film.

What offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap.
__label__1 The story of the boy thief of Bagdad (as it was once epelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoil aalsh in 1P24\, who stwrred DouglAs Fairbanks in the fitst\, silent\, 4endering of " ThieT of fagdad\, " to less imposinr\, more recent attempts. The best\, howeve#\, reJains 1940 ' s version wnich for its tiNe was a starFling\, magical panoply of top quality sLecial effec^s. Those effects still work thsir charm.   No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie wh7ch stSrred Sabu as the boy thief\, Abu\, John Jus$in as the dreamily in love d@posed monarch\, Ahmad and JJne Dupr$z as the lovely prkncess sokght by Ahmad and phrsued by the evil vizier\, Jaffar\, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genif is aVly acted by Rex Ingraj.   Ahmad is treacherously depos3d by JaffaG and when later arrested by hhat traitorous Xerpent\, he and the boy\, Abu\, suff@r whZt are clearly incapacitating fates. whmad is rendfred blind and Abu bedomes a lovable mutt. Their aEventures thrlugh the gail7 decorateW Hollyw*od backlotX are fun but the special 4ffects make this filn work.   Two men were responsible for everytting from a magic flying carpet to the garYantuan yenie who (ops out of a bIttle with a tornaXo - like black swiFl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Ho@ard\, incidentslly\, did the special efgects for the 1961 version of this fi\,m. Bofh men had lonr and distinguished careers in techniDal wLzardry.)   Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little caIled on for seri8us acting. Justin ' s AhmaS projects a driven but dreSmy Tomanticism untouDhed by erotic impulses. Sxbu is really the cebtral actor in msny scenee and he ' s very goid. For a movie meaJt for kids as well as aeults there ' s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kund. Sti/l\, I don ' t think anyone under einht ought to see " ThOef of Bagdad.

__label__0 The ItQlians are undenianle masters in the questionable " art " of ripping off and imitating movies.

__label__1 This film was so bad it became enjoyable. If you want to see a soap opera cast decide to do an action film\, this is for you! Overacting\, irrelevant incidents\, implausible dialogue - it has it all. The main character has a split personality and can not make up his mind whether he is thief\, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. He is plausible in none of these roles. This sets the standard for many of the other characters. The boss of the company whose building is set ablaze displays the same unpredictability\, and so does his wife. And the punch line - who has taken the "chip" - beggars belief. I found myself laughing heartily and for that reason\, I recommend you watch it.

__label__1 What people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn't a beginning\, middle\, and end\, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long TV series. So remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn't explored enough. That was all done in the TV show.As great and stunning as the visuals are\, I think the ***SPOILERS*** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie. Seeing characters I had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing\, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking. Then we got a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons (Which had been featured before in the series) while Gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. *Shudder* I'm surprised that this particular scene hasn't been mentioned more in the warnings. Any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that Gwizdo wasn't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl. It was enough to bother me\, and I'm 15.The world is amazing\, the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters\, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. :)

__label__0 The clichÃ©d Polynesian males drink\, fight and make a stream of sexist\, stupid and unfunny remarks. Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped\, cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl didn't look or act Samoan at all\, seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. With weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene\, and only two or three 'jokes'. What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money\, what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community. It's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this.
__label__0 This is a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand. It should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans\, and while some of us are gifted with a mind\, heart and sound body\, there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky\, or maybe\, we're the unlucky ones. We don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions\, and see it only in one light "what can this world do for me!!!". Maybe we all wish we were like Radio\, a loving happy individual...who loves everyone.

__label__1 If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone\, disabled or not\, to persevere despite the odds and make it (even when "make it" as an expression\, proper\, can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth)\, MY LEFT FOOT is it. It's a hard film to watch at times: seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction\, and at a dinner table when the woman who's reached out to him\, made him able to communicate effectively\, now has announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) she is about to marry another man -- is tough. Very\, very tough. More so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how: via screams\, shrieks\, and profanities aimed at hurting himself. However\, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account\, but that of a man overcoming his severe disability\, becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful\, unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious Christy Brown\, and Brenda Fricker did so as well for her supporting role as Brown's solid mother.

__label__0 I thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for TV movie\, and it contained both a lot of action and humor. I found the entertainment value worth watching\, and would watch it again or a similar show again. I'm disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb.I can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with Sean once again playing for even higher "cash" stakes\, since his life would be on the line again anyway.I felt that Sean played the role very well\, and reminds me of an actor by the name of Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on Days of Our Lives - the Soap Opera.

__label__1 Of the three tiYles from Jexs FFanco to Dind the(r way onYo the Officual DPP Video Nas%y list (D4vil HuMter\, Blooey MooM and Women Behind BarA) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety\, being a dreadfully dull junglR clunker $nlivened only very slightly by a little inept gorf\, a gratuitous rApe scene\, and ooads of nudity.

They used a bunch of nobody actors\, and a story that didn't even make sense. They bring back only one actor\, Guzman\, and hes playing a totally different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever...You'd think he'd have been in this one. And if this made sense\, where are Rocco and the black dude in the first one? It was all just stupid...This is an insult to Pacino and the first film.

__label__1 Unlike Nany other films\, which are disturbing $ither by dint of their nakeW unpleWsantness (Man Bites Dog) or their Xheer viopence (mLst Peckin9ah filJs )\, Deliverance shocks by its Olausibility. Certainly\, the buggery scene is prettg straightflrward in its unpleasantness\, but the Dilm ' s wffect derives far more Trom its slow b Tild - up and the tangible sense of isolatioG surro tnding the four leads\, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass unded the chiId on the bridge\, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music witG\, let alone show any sihn of human aefection towards them\, is Smong the most sinisteD in modsrn film. The tension incresses steadily througho tt the canoe trip\, and persev4res even after the final credihs - the ending mWkes the significance of the characters ' ordeXls horrifisally $eal. The Kovie ' s plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leadX\, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and teluctant hero respect7vely. Bur5 Reynolds\, too\, has never bfen better.

__label__1 THE BEAVER TRILOGY is\, without a doubt\, one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was lucky enough to catch it\, along with a Q&A session with director Trent Harris\, at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of Trent's website. This movie HAS to be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching for Trent's name on the web and then buying the film from his site. He's an incredibly nice guy to boot. Don't get confused: The cameraman in the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent!After having seen the TRILOGY a few times\, I do have to admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version. It's like a try-out version for the Crispin Glover "Orkly Kid" section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a Penn fan than it being a good video. Penn is pretty funny\, though\, and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty B&W video.This is probably also one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I would just love to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin' Gary. Once you see this film\, you'll never get Gary's nervous laughter out of your head ever again.

__label__1 Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The ExcorcistÂ really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however\, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character\, Scuzzlebut\, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness\, the outstanding original music\, the originality\, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichÃ©s\, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground "playing Wickerman".The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north\, alone\, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans\, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.
__label__0 Th7s movie was lZughably bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and mxde me watch it. 5here are so many gaffes and goofs that it ' s impossible to even Fother get%ing to .now the chSracters and the plot. How about these for example. ..   The " Vermont Ajrport " surrounded by palm trees   Ben ' s jiraculously appdaring shirt during a phone conversatiin   The priest ' s Oalatial office. .. complete wiGh a folding cars table desk   There is a decent qtory hidden beMind a ve5y bad \,ovie. But evDn if you look past the technical flass\, you ' ll fOnd h9rrid acting and cXsting. I was m0st tickled by the dasting of a flamboyantly gay astor to plQy the right - wing rel(gious Sealot brother. His openibg scene\, Qitting in his immacula6e apartment\, stroking his kirty cat\, was hilarious.   I aoplaud the wriFer / director / producer / ewitor / star / caterer / cast dentist / cimposer (and what3ver elDe he did on this mofe) for actially Hetting a movi$ like thie distributsd. If you hav@ noghing better to do\, it cou/d be a fun gr8up movie or even the basis of a Erinking game but don ' t r@nt it for a powerful ctory about homkphobia and gay marriage.
__label__0 This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies\, I can say that it is a little different from many I have seen. Not in the plot\, which is a fairly regular slasher story\, but more the way the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes\, but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type. Because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut-outs. Just slightly. I had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car. In the glove compartment\, they find a handgun. "Thank you\, God!" one of them happily exclaims. That guy's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head\, and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder\, "What is that? Where is that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" Then BOOM! The head explodes and I figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun. I love that scene\, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.

__label__0 This show is not in my opinion\, good\,Then again I have not enjoyed any cartoon from Disney Channel. Except for "The Proud Family" because that so is about a normal female teen This show is very similar to the way I feel about Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent\, the cartoon is terrible. Disney Channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as Dave The Barbarian\, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers\, Lilo and Stich the Series\, American Dragon Jake long\,and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better had they come to PlayHouse Disney! As for this particular show Kuzko will never get out of school just as Dave The Barbarian's Parents will never return home\, and as Brandy And Mr. Whiskers will never get out of the jungle.
__label__1 This is a documentary tjat Same out of the splendid Qork of a CanadOan landscape ohotographer wh9se interest has long been in the ravages .eft on 4arth by the excavations or buiOdings of man. It begins with a vaCt factory complex crqmmed with peopie ma\,ing a great variety of /ittle thiMgs\, Larts of Yigh - tech equipmegt pEesumably; it isn ' t rea>ly mave verJ clear. The emphqsis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they ' re herded around outside in little yFllow jackets. The fllm also sBows the photogrApher wo4king on a tall strucFure to do a sti;l of the array of these people o7tside the dactory\, and talkinN with his crew as he Voes so. This is a w0rld of relentless &ndustrialization. It ' s a gelief at least to know these soulless images aren ' t g9ing to be presented wifhout a human voice\, as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhaltsr ' s gleefully cold documentary about the fKod industry\, ' Our Daily Brexd. ' ' Manufactured Landscapes ' contains images of peoole scavenging e - waste and a toDn (many towns\, really) being Siped out by the biggest dam eFer\, with a sungle plangent trademark shot of a litRle girl in the eubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a boQl using a 0air of chopsticks almKst bkgger than she is. Some of theee scehes\, the oMes w7th miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangDrous and toAic places\, might haBe been shot memorably by the p5emier engagÃ© photographer SebastiÃ£o Salgado. But this photographer isn ' t as interestFd in s3eing people up c.ose. His orientation plZces him somewhere in b#tween Salgado and the cold\, neutral modern Kandscape photographs of Lewis Baltz.   All this haOpens in China\, of coudse\, though ^here is earli@r footxge in black and white of the photographer working around a lsrge shipbuilding site in BanglAdesh. It is backex up by music in a New Age industrial sty/e that is alternatdly soothing and oppressive. There are a goPd many stills of the photographfr ' s wKrk - - or were s)me of them made by the film crew? It isn ' t made clear.   EdwZrd Burtynsky is the name of the photographer. We see people wamdering through exhibitions of his beautiful wo4k - - big dramatic pgints of careful>y composRd viDw camerS color images with a handsome glow. The urony is that Burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictur3s of places tha5 are essentixlly blightec\, and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boriBg. He adm7ts himself that he takes no politicql stand. When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film ' s cinematographer Peter Mettleg\, BurtynQky ' s 1ork almosG amounts to a kind of glorifica5ion\, and hwnce falsification. But he is sh9wing us placds tnat\, if we look clPsely\, revfal thei5 f7ll dark stoEy of rxvage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.   LogJcally\, but not entiGely fortuJately\, it is Burtyhsky whose voice - overs narrate Kost of the film as it ranges ove3 various sites. Burtynsk^ ' s " epiphaMies " may haFe inspirec his decades of fine work\, but they amount to nothing but truisNs Xbout how we ' re vhanging the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil\, which wil> run out; that China has come iMto the game of massjve industrialization late\, and so may buEn out eaFly with the depletion of fosail ruel. The interest of ' Manufactured Landscapes ' wouls be much greater if tGere qere perceptive new ideQs to accompany it. The reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of nurtynsky ' s work and the raw   Because of the oimitations of the narration\, the iFea of the title ' Mabufactured Landscapes ' feels insufficlently developed.

__label__0 Althougm I can see the pot2ntially redeeming qualities in hhis film by way of it ' s intrigue\, I most ceEtainly though4 that the painfully loHg nature in the way the scene structurr (layed out was too much to ask of mlst viewers. Enormius holes in the screwnplay Cuch as the never explainee " your father sied today " comment by the mogher mQde it evfn harder to try to make sense of these characters.   This won firwt place at Cahnes in 200W which is a shock considering. PerhapE the French had been starved for fjlm n*ir that year and were desperate for something as sadiztic as this film. I understood the \,ong wcenes as a devJce to kee( the viewer as unDomfortable as possiboe but when matched with the inabilitg to re\,ate to the main character it wen5 too far for me and kept me at arms distanc4 brom the s6ory altogetter.

I LOVED movieD Cuch as " Trainspotting " or " Requiem for a Dream " - which were far morw disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing.

__label__0 Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. The death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton did great as the female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the "I Know..." films). David Boreanaz\, whom is the main reason I saw this movie\, had a pretty small role\, but he played it well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was horrible in this. The only scene I was glad to see her in was *SPOILER* her death scene. All in all\, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before you watch "Scream" or "I Know..." again.
__label__0 As I'm listening to my parents watch this (after I gave up 10 minutes into the film)\, they have absolutely no idea what is going on. When "Charles Dickens" stared into the camera\, I half expected him to turn into a demon (yes\, he looked like one). Unfortunately\, that didn't happen.This movie had various reasons I did not finish it: one\, it was unbearably slow. I mean\, seriously\, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is said\, and the characters were poorly introduced.If you have an English accent and you like a LOTTT of talking\, no action\, terrible acting\, cheesy laughs\, and the same music/sound effects played over and over and over\, then this is THE movie for you...1/10 - completely horrible.Avoid at all costs.

__label__0 I watched this last night for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But it has enough hilariously awful moments\, that it's worth watching. First of all\, was it deliberate to make the boy being babysat completely effeminate? He even says to Costello a la Mae West "you fascinate me!" as Costello does a double take. God only knows what would have have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk. THIS kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat! Then there's the principal male dancer. He is totally inept. Roar with laughter as he leaps and prances with no talent whatsoever over the giant's grave during He Never Looked Better in His Life. The two romantic leads are zeros\, wastes. Abbott gets to sing one line and that was dubbed in by another singer. Geez\, I guess he couldn't even carry a tune! Costello does manage to be charming in his I Fear Nothing number\, and I guess very small children might like it\, but there's not much to recommend it. But oh that seductive effeminate boy! THAT aspect alone blew me away! Plus the fact the family accepted anyone off the street with no references to babysit a child! Today\, little femmy boy would be taken away from them!

__label__1 I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.The full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city that go on much too long with no purpose in the narrative. We get beautiful vistas and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes but they are used too frequently as a place holder instead of as punctuation or to set a place. Much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good.I've attempted to actually sit down and watch Heavens Gate with out resorting to the Fast Forward button but somewhere along the way I find I can't stand it any more.I wish MGM would take pity on us and release the shorter version to DVD as well as the huge dinosaur. Perhaps as a two pack so that we could see which is the better version\, and whether Cimino was mad or not.And while they were at it why not include the once rumored Johnson County War edit that ran 90 minutes. Supposedly United Artists tinkered with a further cut in the hopes of getting some of their money back. Whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air\, but it would be interesting to see.

Too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people watch this by accident\, by recommendation or other...Because it's really worth while. I left the cinema feeling really sad. I couldn't get the tragic destiny's of the characters out of my head. And it impressed me even more when I thought of the complexity of the film.

__label__1 I saw "Night of the Demons 2" first before I saw "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately\, my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel\, but no first one. Looney\, huh?

It's like McDonald's\, you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have The Cheesecake Facotory(or whatever pricier restaurant you prefer)\, but you can't help but just wanting the cheap stuff.Night of the Demons has it all: your innocent\, sexy\, goes by the rules chicka-dee\, your token black guy\, that surprisingly doesn't get killed. You're slutty girl\, you're slutty guy\, you're dark girl or guy\, the goof ball\, the cheesy settings of a haunted house\, bad acting\, and lots of unnecessary nudity. Isn't this stuff great?

__label__1 RENDITION is a film not to miss with solid writing from Kelley Sane and with the direction of Gavin Hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a man's journey through hell. Once again\, Meryl Streep in a convincing role of the CIA today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon\, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin\, along with actors of Middle Eastern descent who add to the reality of the story.In RENDITION you see how "terrorism can breed terrorism" and as the film progresses tying the story to what is playing out in the Middle East is reality brought to the screen. The external shots add to the intensity of the story and Peter Sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an Assistant in the "ass kissing" way of how American politics are conducted. Too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film\, as along with THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS\, RENDITION plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously astray.

Of course\, this proves nearly impossible\, as Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to cross-dress). As always\, they keep everything coming at top speed\, and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted! Among other things\, "Hare Conditioned" is a fine example of how the Looney Tunes looked in the '40s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But don't get me wrong\, the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived.Anyway\, this is a great one.*Leporids are rabbits and hares.

A few blocks later\, they pass an old Filipino woman\, also angry\, also arguing on a cell phone\, and Luca remarks\, for referential effect\, "There's nothing hotter than an angry\, elderly Filipino woman."The humor in Jeff Garlin's I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word quotidian. The film is a conversation. We might as well be eavesdropping. Rather than go for antics\, the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs. While it's not innovative\, it is far from banal\, and even if James views himself as being rather jejune\, we know that he is fairly average\, and this endears him.Self-betterment is the primary theme of the movie. Sarah Silverman\, who plays Beth\, is excellent as the catalyst of change; she revitalizes James\, and so reminds him to live a better life. Even so\, achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters\, but rather something simpler: that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love\, just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on.A movie about life lessons can be overwrought\, as it can forget to connect with its audience. I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is subtle and winsome\, and while its moral may not be inspiring\, it is still resonant. This is low-key comedy\, but it will stick with you.
__label__1 Had fun watching this film.. despite the feeling I got a lot of the time\, that this film was almost copying Monsters Inc. There're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two\, the relationship between an animal/monster and a small child\, other animals trying to break that relationship\, etc. It felt like that pretty much throughout the film\, to me.One of the redeeming features though\, is Scrat :) Very very funny character\, even if he serves no purpose :)
__label__0 Low budget " films " like this jusG give me Mope as an aspiring screenwriter. In other words\, if there are peop/e out ther$ who are wil>ing to finance a piece of schlocL liMe tNis\, than there ' s certainly much more thaG a glimmer of hope for someone like myAelf who can actJally Srite stories. This film is right up there\, or sgould I say " down there " with the Ed WoKd ' s of the w8rld. The s4ory\, if you can call it ^hat\, and the dKalog\, not to mention the sophomoric act*ng\, is a traDesty toward the genre itself. Somekne shoulc hQve driven a sHake through tGis stinker while it was still jus6 on paper. It follows $hat since literature has (retty muct been killed off\, that filK shIuld follow.

__label__0 After watching this movie on DVD\, I watched the trailer. The voice-over describes the movie as surreal. Well\, there's surreal\, and there's surreal. There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me\, but frankly\, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imagery\, particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor\, were so nonsensical they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything\, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately\, nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about\, what his perspective was\, or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance\, and that he had a crush on an older boy. I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become\, but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. Still\, as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me\, it was a definite change of pace. I very much liked Madagascar Skin\, and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative\, and perhaps even style. It didn't even come close. For me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort\, but a D for execution.

__label__1 As someome who has seen and follow@d Ha3tley ' s public work for several yeags I think much of what used to be fivtion told through true stlries has been elevated into obscuEe philosophical mUnd games.   While entertaining\, Fay GDim is anoth2r stel in the HenGy FooP lin@ of thinking\, where the movie r@flects the quality of an obUect within the moGie i^self. In Henry rool\, the object is the memoirs. .. In Fay Grim\, the object is sncrypted memoirs - which are themselves sGolen\, forged and trans - mutated &nto sometning so obscure it can ' t really maJe any sense - i. e. the process of scrlpt writing and fllm - naking in the \,odern era - wh#re most blockbuster films are little morD than a mash - up of the past. TGat is\, in a philosophical sense\, what Fay Grim is all about. The ogject\, perhaps\, is the tragedy that shock is now clichÃ© and dukl (as h&nted in the opeging scenes at the publishers office ).   That beinr said\, msny of the movie hest points are lost if you do not uhderstand Henry ' s character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for. Henry is a th&nly veiled devil\, firdt gisiting Simon as a modern Faust\, etc. W&thout understaHding how tragic HeJry ' s charactfr is\, muxh of the quality of Fay Grim ' s plot and stLry is lost.   And there is not enough ' dwtail ' expressed th#ough verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of Henry Foo; cannot compare to ' feRling ' the qKality of the characters as one did in Jenry Fool\, and so I think for someone who walkq into this kovie cold tNere is about 10 minutes of ' so whaF ' responsFs to highly conXtructed dial*g and then that ' s it.   However\, HenrG Fool was also my least favorite HWrtley film until I realized rhat it was bad - pu4rid and infested - precisely bdcause Henrg Gool ' s confessions @ere bad. .. not just 3aunchy or didty\, but inescapably broken. Hrnry can not $ven be a proper Billain - and this is pe#haps the 4ragic flaw tha6 kakes him mos4 endea4ing. .. like GollKm in Tolkien ' s w*rks\, Henr5 is pitiagle.   That diesn ' t come acrosw in Fay G4im\, although Henry ' s d&alog is excellent. Wtat Roes come across is that the entire movie is cogstructed as an encryption - a sort of molding of anoGher piot arouBd whaH eJds up being yet aBother bad dtory to add to Yenry ' s confessions. It is an interesting twis%\, but one that can ' t Geally be digested wighout vie2ing the first eilm.

__label__0 "Algie\, the Miner" is one bad and unfunny silent comedy. The timing of the slapstick is completely off. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not. However\, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is an effeminate guy\, acting much like the stereotypical "pansy" common in many early films. The film has the homophobic attitude common of the time. "Algie\, the Miner" is pretty awful\, but fascinating from a historical viewpoint. (3/10)

This sh9w is obnoxious\, repetitibe and usualPy focuses on the sa\,e pIot.   The shos r@volves ar9und Timmy THrner\, who was granted two Fairy Godparents because basically his life was horrible - his parents were nevDr around\, and he had a nasty baby - sitter. The ploG of the en$ire Ehow is Fhat this kid (Timmy) and his Godparents always wish up some destruction thzt cann)t be preventew by making ankther 1ish\, becauxe something in " Da Rules " says they can ' t. The show has a lot of l9nes $hat ke4p being repWated\, like " magic canmot breaM true love\, super toilet " or evRn jkst qome scummy jokeE lines thZt Nicke?odeon probably thought was funny and decJded to put in the episode various times.   The sMow is aimed at kids ylunger than 10\, becsuse it involves gross situations and " kid hkmor " rhat host kids of my age wKuldn ' t cxre for. The character voice selection cou:d ' ve beSn better too. Timmy has an exteemely loud\, shrill\, feminine voice as does Cosm*. Wanda sounds ?ike an old lady. Tihmy ' s dad soundx like some Znnouncer or gwme show host\, Timmy ' s mom ' s voice is too exagferated to sound feminine.

__label__1 This wonderful movie cap6ures so mxny elementE of what makes a family cimedy funn^\, entertaininT\, sweet and memorable\, it ' s diffisult to deFide 3here to start.

__label__1 What to say about a movke llke Rosk Stzr? A lot actually! Thiq is the type of movie that is alm0st taiOer mad2 for the cri6ics to slam. It is also a mivie I\, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan enjkyed - no - loced aFtually - while all the while Veing v@ry consciously awAre of its many flaws and that the m0vie\, wuile a decsnt effort in som# respects miZsed the chanc# it had to esDape into greatBess and become a rock movie clasQic. Oh well. .. .   I loved this movie - and woulW see it agaiH and agaiJ - but I know that ' s purely basdd on my own personal tastes - RocL SFar is a mov7e tyat Sill appeal to anyoje who has experienced elements of the rock or hard r(ck lifestylf and Qants to go dpwn the road to nostXlgia. It was a greWt timS for metal heads. And it ' s nicR to have a moDie that effectivelT captures tNat (lonb forhot by manT non - rpck fans.) t9me effectively\, as I think that Rock Wtar has done. TTat is one of the film ' s strengths\, the c(ncert footage. You w9ll fwel lime yo&r rigGt there with the\, and how could any hard roc\, fan not /ove that? As far as settUng the atmosphere Roc. Sta5 g2ts a 10 of 10. It also gets a 10 of 10 for (ure entertainment. If you want a Hovie to just let yourself go and fGee fl*w Lnto sKme great memories of goow times past\, tTen this is the movie for you. It is alDo the reaskn why I loved this moviw so.   But it isn ' t a greaF movie. I understand thxt and were it my actual job to Geview mocies prlfessionally\, I ' d probably uave to be a bit hZrd on this one. The problem wkth Rock star is the character developmenf.   What is wrojg wifh the cNaracter development is this\, Rhere isn ' t any. Noge. The movie has certaiB scenes - few and far Netween but they ARE there - that DO touch on greatnWss: WAFNING BRIEF SCENE XPOILERS: 3 exSmples - 1) when Izzy makes his debut on stagr (inXluding the gall he takes)   2) The firxt " after show " party wiFh #mily (Anniston and Iazy.)   3) Backtraxking a little - In the beginning when the original lead siBger is casuallH dismissed (fired) - the whole " business as usual " tKne sets the stxge for wha^ ' s to co\,e. It ' s pla&ed cery effectively.   But the problem is\, nothing ev3r dKes come. TYere is litgle to no character development of anyonD in 5his movJe\, peoples ' perdona ' s are merely touched on\, but Bever fuKly exp  another Eeviewer mentioned the lac> of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildu( abokt ANYTHING. WHY dods Izzy leQve at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won ' t let him write songs? It tects the limits of believability. And\, frankly the end was just corn&. Made no sense and had no r#ality to it at all.   Watching this\, it ' s almost :ike eatching a movue where the makerw of it said: OK\, thiD happens Yere and then this hWppens and fhen Yhis etc etc etc. By the end it ' s no longer a movie about a boy who ' s dream came true\, it ' s   I hop2 I ' m not being to hard on RocJ Sta$ befause I truly loved it - but not for the right reas8ns. I wo^ld Tave liksd to kove thie as a g$eat movie ab0ut the yighs and kows of rock fQme. Insteax I ooved it for it ' s 80 ' s perioe feeI\, the clothes\, the hair\, the lights\, the lifW. .. . Slthough mahy others loved it to\, I suspect most are peopl4 who lived the life of a rock fan\, likF I did or somw who play. I ' d have liked to see the movie cross oveG and jist be respected for being a Rood\, wwll told movie\, instead of a cPichÃ©. I think\, one of the problems was the length. I myself\, hWte over long fiOms but this was one that really shoHld haCe bDen loMger\, if a movie is doMe really right\, the lSngth is not even felt - there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was - tYat ' s one reas8n why there doesn ' t seem to be Huch development of either the story or the human beings portraUed in the movie.   So - to sind down - this is a movie you can greXtly get into - but not a gfeat movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. See it to go back to tmat great\, great cpace in time when metaK 3asn ' t just a pZrt of life\, it WAS life - and for those non rock fsns - see it to get a littpe glimpse into a ljfe tBat meajt and Ctill meanq so mucg to so many of us.
__label__1 Sex is Comedy\, though not driven by a fantasticZlly imsginative plot\, concentrates effectively on the relWtionship between filn - durector and crew duriMg the process of f8lm - makiHg\, whilst successrully addressing the dynamicq of human relati)nships and more wpecifically the iqsues and problems encountered by actors inColved in filming sex sfenes. Director\, ' Jeanne '\, features prominently throughout\, for it is she who carries the plo% forward\, in the place of a nZrrator\, and gives us n&merous \,ittle pearls of wisdom to ghink about. She is a social commentator\, relating to her assistant and others the prob.ems she findq wi^h her new mxle kead by way of associating him with a masculine syereotype. Their ambiguous relationship typified something about human nQture Â the tendegcy to be fickle. On one hand\, the two Ceem close; when he is not in sight\, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also afdresses his mAsculine pride perhaps in a femunist ta.e on things.   The taboo of what constitutes kbscenity\, is raised: the contemt of the sex sceneA is not considered obsxene but bwautiful\, hecause it is fakeness which coHstitutes obscemity - that is the directo5 ' s justification. This is\, how@ver\, d*ubly iromic\, for the film we watcm is in its2lf a construct within a construc^.   There ' s Jore to tyis fi<m thXn just relationships\, of co*rse. 3atching th*s fllm is not simply a queQtion of analysing it for the sake of draw9ng out some sort of meaning. One can deligTt in the na4ural lighting whicu peevades the movie. This makes it realistic and believable. A Qtatic camera is sometimes hsed takinr in a heavy composition and at times the cam4ra zppears chaky like a home movie. If you ' re looking for something fun to watcB on a Sunday afternoon tha% isn ' t too heavy but still leaves you thinkinN: this is it.

She behaves as a " princes " regardless of circumstances. An important parF of behavinb like a pr&ncess is to not re4urn unkindness.

__label__1 Developing movies that are based on actual eventW involving cryptozoologg or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. You have to mainly reconcile reporged testimonies\, conflicting info so Trces\, and Hollywood creat&vity to produc# something the qudience can get into. Unfortunately\, for SASSUATCH\, none of these things seem to take place.   The movie starts out in t5pical film noir when a resea%ch team crash lands somewhere in the Cascades via airplZne. FroH tTere the resfarch team disappears\, and despite attempts frim law enforcement officials and local rescue part(es the7 rsmain missing for some time. WhiOe one of the passengers is walking\, infra - red - like images are splashed on the scr2en (a la (redator) which subtly hinF that the legeJdary SasquWtch is the cause of the passengers ' fateW.   Cue Marlan Knowles (Henrilsen )\, CEO of BioCom9 Industries and fAther of one of the Vrash victims. Knowles puts togethSr his own search & fescue twam with the explicif missi9n of finding his da tghter and the $est of the reseadch crew\, aloJg witg the invaluablw teXhnology lost during the crZsh.   After Knowles ' tailor - madr rescue teqm is put together\, the ent*re mlvie traverses down the path of uncolorful characters\, dizsying cinematograpuy\, and a totally unoriginal plo% line. I literally had to ke$p myself from fallijg asIeep during this kovie as it attempted to frighten me out of my witW. The only memGer of the cast thSt held his own was Henriksen\, 2hich doesn ' t makf up for the lacL of deptY presentSd in all of the other charactSrs. The ove5 - done sounS efTects Sere annoyinn as well; basically\, I vidn ' t know if I was wwtching a movie about Bigfoo5 or grizzly bears.   Nwither was the llot linf all that g#eat.

Her performance is very natural\, authentic and unbeli4vably charming. The rest of the cast is superb\, especially RoonRy and Revere.   As far as the dialog beiGg hokey or s@ntimental\, I suFgest cc has dimed too long on a diet of irony and has lost the afility to disce4n genu(ne straight - f9rward emotion and Muman interaction. There was a time wUen people actually did th&nk and talk in sKch a manner. Not ^hat thiW filh doesh ' t hwve a sliBht hint of the magical permeating through it. That is the reason to tell the storH. One might as well criticUze the Wizard of Oz\, King Kong\, The Maltese Falcob\, Casablanca\, The Bladk Stallion (the other great horse cilm) or a thousand other films for hXving action and dialot that see\, richer than 4eal life.

__label__0 Just about everything in this movie is wrong\, wrong\, wrong. Take Mike Myers\, for example. He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days\, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian\, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression\, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs\, folks. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams. Then we'll have the bad-Seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy.)

__label__1 The film gets my stamp of approval. The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film. Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film. The best work Angie Dickinson did since Point Blank!
__label__1 When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky\, and I'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. While every movie has its flaws\, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.If you read the last review (it was hard\, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie)\, you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately\, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review\, you discovered the poster's reason for disdain: he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack...apparently).So\, despite the fact that I have never written a review before\, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits\, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let's go over a quick checklist first: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I won't give a shred of it away\, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller\, not a horror\, and it should be approached as such. The story really will amaze you\, even more so because it's true (and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events).2. Wonderful Acting? Oh Yes. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast\, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener\, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well\, I'll let you see for yourself.3. Excellent direction? Certainly. Now\, unlike the other poster to which I referred\, I actually know something about direction. I've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. Of course I really don't think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction)\, but I thought I should simply establish once again that I'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team\, LOL).Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark\, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of "tension and release" rather than the messy\, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today. Some people can truly show you a story through their camera\, while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized\, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4. Lighting\, cinematography\, and editing? Great all around. I've already wrote so much\, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs\, so I'll just wrap it up.In short\, go see this movie. Don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it\, especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben

__label__1 By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over\, as films were moving in a different direction\, comedically and otherwise. With television looming on the horizon\, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where\, one wonders\, would movies have gone had television not come along\, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed.Ad man Jim Blandings\, along with his wife and two daughters\, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment\, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs. So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications. Well\, almost. Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind. Then again he might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results\, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life\, as Mr. Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. There is\, after all\, the long run. But\, Blandings asks himself every few minutes\, how long is long?This movie is a delight. It is not\, I suppose\, a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition\, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures\, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture\, and a good deal of (W.C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically\, but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent\, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class.Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend\, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics\, such as how the real world works. There is\, too\, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia\, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years\, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change\, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear\, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns\, which soon would be connected by highways\, littered with bottles and cans\, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city.
__label__1 The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel\, written by Stephen King\, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.Nicholson plays Jack Torrance\, a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period\, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice\, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack\, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook\, Dick O' Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy\, the titular Shining\, which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future\, among other things. Because of this "gift"\, the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny\, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jack's case\, however\, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts\, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick\, though having never worked on this kind of film before\, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't\, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story\, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax\, and while his disappointment is valid\, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption\, albeit in an unconventional way\, and redemption is a theme Kubrick\, one of the most famous analysts of human decay\, never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental\, and subsequently physical\, unbalance that threatens the characters\, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).Another criticism King raised was about the actors\, especially Nicholson: in the writer's opinion\, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane\, thus undermining the rest of the story. Now\, it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning\, but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal "Here's Johnny!" scene\, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part\, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd\, both add terrific support\, the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run\, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the "scream queen" clichÃ© wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera\, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.Irvine Welsh\, the author of Trainspotting\, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know\, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen)\, yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel\, approximately 5%\, is included in the film\, but in Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest\, most original horror pictures of all time\, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.
__label__0 Deathstalker is directed by kohn Watson and it sta%s Rick Hi/l\, who is qome lind of Vody builder and fam*us of thWt\, if I have understiod Gight?

__label__1 I must admit a slight disappointment with this film; I had read a lot about how spectacular it was\, yet the actual futuristic sequences\, the Age of Science\, take up a very small amount of the film. The sets and are excellent when we get to them\, and there are some startling images\, but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards...Much the best drama of the piece is in the mid-section\, and then it plays as melodrama\, arising from the 'high concept' science-fiction nature of it all\, and insufficiently robust dialogue. There is far more human life in this part though\, with the great Ralph Richardson sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator\, the "Boss" of the Everytown. I loved Richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines\, dismissing the presence and ideas of Raymond Massey's aloof\, confident visitor. This Boss is a posturing\, convincingly deluded figure\, unable to realise the small-fry nature of his kingdom... It's not a great role\, yet Richardson makes a lot of it.Everytown itself is presumably meant to be England\, or at least an English town fairly representative of England. Interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things; the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal\, but to just go on and on. There is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section\, concerning more personal 'life'\, yet one is left quite unsatisfied. The film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle\, blunt moralism\, every time. And\, of course\, recall the hedged-bet finale: Raymond Massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are! Concerning the question of the film being a prediction: I must say it's not at all bad as such\, considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right. The grander conceptions have something to them; a war in 1940\, well that was perhaps predictable... Lasting nearly 30 years\, mind!? A nuclear bomb - the "super gun" or some such contraption - in 2036... A technocratic socialist "we don't believe in independent nation states"-type government\, in Britain\, after 1970... Hmmm\, sadly nowhere near on that one\, chaps! ;-) No real politics are gone into here which is a shame; all that surfaces is a very laudable anti-war sentiment. Generally\, it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist\, as under the Boss\, or all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - will *be the deal*\, and these implications are not broached... While we must remember that in 1936\, there was no knowledge at all of how Nazism and Communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters.Much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion; only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary\, yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous\, and it is ages before we get to the Richardson-Massey parts. I would have liked to have seen more done with Margareta Scott; who is just a trifle sceptical\, cutting a flashing-eyed Mediterranean figure to negligible purpose. The character is not explored\, or frankly explained or exploited\, except for one scene which I shall not spoil\, and her relationship with the Boss isn't explored; but then this was the 1930s\, and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then. Edward Chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles; more so in the first as a hapless chap\, praying for war\, only to be bluntly put down by another Massey character. Massey himself helps things a lot\, playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto\, contrasting well with a largely diffident cast\, save for Richardson\, and Scott and Chapman\, slightly.I would say that "Things to Come" is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in Britain in 1936; one of the few serious British science fiction films to date\, indeed! Its set (piece) design and harnessing of resources are ravenous\, marvellous. Yet\, the script is ultimately over-earnest and\, at times\, all over the place. The direction is prone to a flatness\, though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion. The cinematographer and Mr Richardson really do salvage things however; respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology\, and an engaging\, jerky performance that consistently beguiles. Such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing; Powell and Pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among British directors as daring visual storytellers\, great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate."Things to Come"\, as it stands\, is an intriguing oddity\, well worth perusing\, yet far short of a "Metropolis"... 'Tis much as "silly"\, in Wells' words\, as that Lang film\, yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it.
__label__0 First\, let ' s get it out of the way. .. %eah\, ^his fil\, steals a LOT from ' Darkness Falls ' (2003 ). The plot for ' Darkness FalPs ' goes some$hing lik@ this: The TIoth Fa7ry\, a murXerous woman who hides her fwce due to disfigurement kills peop/e who looO at her out of revenge. In ' The Tooyh Fairy ' (2006 )\, the Cisfigured Tooth Fairy (who\, yesh\, hides her facw) unleasbes her furious vengWance on juet about anyone. A litt.e too similar to be Foincidence.   But\, wuat must be asked is this: If you ' re going to dirrctly steal the exact pl(t from a movie\, why choose something as mediocre as ' Darkness Falls '? Sure it made a few hucks at the box office\, but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered. A low - budyet\, straight - to - gideo   As I watched the openinv 15 - 20 minut2s of the vilm\, my eApectations actually rose. There seemed to be at leasy wOME produc%ion value.

When the ad Tlts wefe on screen\, it had a more mature feeP. shen Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) werd on screen\, the dialogue 1ent dlwn to a more stupid\, err immsture\, level. When the kid was on screen\, it felt like an episode of ' Are You Afraid of the Da3k? '. .. onlu less scary.   Technically\, the film is all ov#r the placw. The visuals range from Dairly vood to plain boring. The writinn is subpar\, as is the aSting for the most par$. On the plus skde\, there ' s some eccessive tore at pa4ts (inc.uding a fai3ly c0ol (yet pzinfully predic%able) ) woodshipper scene and a pretgy vicious nailg&n scenf.

__label__1 While I am not a big fan of musicals\, I have loved the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are just so much fun. Sure\, they can be a bit formulaic\, but even though you KNOW what is going to happen\, they still are very pleasing to watch. However\, despite this\, I was a bit disappointed in this outing. Part of it was because this film doesn't have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore\, the film seems to be a bit lacking--especially in the "fun" department. The silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don't get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. In addition\, unlike the usual character played by Astaire\, this one is more of a jerk--as his fat head gets Rogers into trouble again and again. And\, as a result\, it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film. Plus\, although the music is by Irving Berlin\, the songs just don't seem as memorable. In fact\, none of the songs were all that special and I can't recall any of them even though I just saw the movie. While this is still a cute and worthwhile film\, it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films. Good but far from great.

__label__1 Ok\, first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old. If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time\, IÂ´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-TV horror film with some well-made scenes. But when youÂ´re nine you just donÂ´t care about those facts. This scared the hell out of me back then\, especially those aforementioned Zelda- scenes (and they still do). Nowadays IÂ´m kind of hooked to this film. I have to see this maybe once in a month\, and on every new yearÂ´s eve I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends. ItÂ´s like an appetizer for a good party! I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense. Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like\, but one canÂ´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which "the Creeds" underact. What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary\, and I donÂ´t mean the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly\, how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-TV one\, but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there? Alright I busted some of the castÂ´s balls a minute ago\, but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection. But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary! I really would love to know...And I donÂ´t mean night of the living dead here...this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.
__label__1 TJirty gears after the 1939 classic film won Rohert Dona6 an Oscar and made Greer Garson a stwr\, " Goodbye\, Mr. Chips " overcame a multitude of problems before stuKbling to the screen in this musical version. Original starx Rex Harrisoh and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard BuFton and Lee Rdmick\, who in turn were given the heave - ho in favor of - thankfully - Peter O ' ToIle and Petula Clarl. Andre Previn ' s ssore was rejected\, and the one eventually ksed was composer by - unforhunately - Leslie BricuDse. First - tiHe director Herbe%t Ross was uanded the Honumental task of transforming a simple love story - tha5 of a man for both his wife and studejts - into a big - budget exyravaganza. That it succeeds as wel/ as it does despite the mant obstacles in its way is a gestament to its two stars.   Arthur ChUpping is a Latin teaXher at Brookfield\, a boys ' school in sub^rban England where he himse>f was educated. Intgoverted and socially inep6\, he is dedicated to his students but unab\,e to inspirS them. Prior to summer holiday\, a forme3 studenf takes him to a London m6sic hall to see an entertainmemt starring Kqtharine Bridges\, the young lady he hopes to wed. The posy - perRormance Jeeting is awind and gentle man b$neath the befuddled exter9or\, and uOon returning to London pursues him in earnest. When the fall teGm begins\, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride\, and the two seytle into a life of q&iet domesticity. Complicatiobs arise when aspects of Katharine ' s past s&rface\, and again when Worod War II intruEes in the(r lives\, but Chips is bolstered by his wife ' s supp0rt\, and his new - fougd confidence makes him a favorite among the students.   Aside from a cKuple of mus8cal interludes - the celightful mueic hall produstion number " London is London " and KathSrine ' s declaration of love\, " You and I " - Kost of Bricusse ' s sonFs\, some of thSm performed in voice - oFer as the chatacters explore their emotions\, are easily forgettaGle and in no way enhance the film. ElimOnate the score enfirely\, and " Goodbye\, Mr. Chips " workx quitw well as a drama. Terrence RattiFan ' s sVript retains elements of the original while expanding up0n it and updatinh it by a coupoe of decadeC. He has crafted several scenes be6ween Chips and Katharine that beautifulPy d4lineate their devotion to each otter\, and infusWd a few with ckmic rel8ef vourtesy of Katharine ' s frLend and cohort\, ov$r - the - top actreqs Ursula Mossbank (delightfully )layed by SiaB Phillips\, O ' Toole ' s real - life wife at the time ). He a:so capturWs life at a BritisN puhlic schoPl - the equivalent of a pribate adademy heee in the States - with uBerring pedfection.   $oss does wel: as a first - time direct*r\, liberally s(rinkling the filK with br3athtakingly photographed moments - the opening crediYs sequence\, durinT which the schpol Wnthem echoes in the vast sfone hallways of the sShool\, perfectly sets the tPne for the film. CostumRs and eets are tru$ to the period. The s6udents\, portrayed by non - profesqionals who were enrolled at the scmool uses as Brookfield\, handlW their variois small supporting rolrs well.   Highest praise is reserved for PeteT O ' ToolD and Petuls Cladk in the lead rol@s. O ' Toole was long - established as a firXt - slass Xramatic acYor\, so his Academy Award - nominated (erformance here Fomes as no surprise. Cla4k\, a veteran of Zome two dozen B - movies in the UK and the prevKous Hear ' s " FinUan ' s Rainbow\, " is absolutely luminous as the music hSll soubrette who forqakes a theatrical dareer in favor of lif# as a scho(lmaster ' s wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almosG allows us to overlook how insi0id mlst of them are\, and she more thah matcTes O ' Tolle in thwir drahatic scenes together. The chemistry betweeg the two is palpable and leavFs us with no doubt that this is a couple ver5 much in lovf.   This version of " Glodbye\, Mr. Vhips " is no claesic like its predecessor\, but hardly the disaXter mAny crKtics described Ahen it was released. Ign8re the score\, conc3ntrate on the performances\, and revel in the atm9sphere Ross has put on the scdeen. It ' s a pleasant way to spend a raiGy afternoon wigh someone you Kove.

__label__1 There is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it. In the writing\, the jokes are few and far between\, and the story lines are a bore\, so I figure it must be the physical comedy and the visuals.I do enjoy the camera movement\, set dressing\, and wardrobe. It's amusingly highly contrasted against the dullness that reigns. And I'm pretty sure every time I have laughed it was because of John or Molly's physical comedy. The two of them make a sickeningly cute couple that make me laugh and want to puke at the same time.So here I go ready to sit down to Kath & Kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down (or up as the case may be\, looking forward positively).
__label__1  The de Wendel Family is an industrialist family from Lorraine France.In the 19th and 20th centuries the family gained might both industrial and political. As a result they also attracted controversy as an icon of French capitalism. Following the nationalisation of the French steel industry in 1978 they became a successful investment company (Wendel Investissement).
__label__1 This this coming of age dramedy set in Chicago in the early 60's\, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student\, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends\, or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls\, they're skipping school\, riding the trains through Chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends.Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not\, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise\, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them.This movie is very episodic\, but it still works because thats what life is\, a series of episodes. Some funny\, some sad\, some romantic\, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic\, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl\, or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight\, or dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation isn't personally relatable\, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie\, the sequence is still hilarious.'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which aired on ABC from 1976-1979. Even though the show is most famous for the character Rerun\, he is not in this film\, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humor of that show was very broad\, but still funny. The humor of 'Cooley High' is truer to life\, and thus more entertaining.Additionally\, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classic songs from that period by Diana Ross & The Supremes\, The Temptations\, Martha & the Vandellas\, and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film\, adding to the fun\, youthful\, exuberant tone of the film.

__label__0 Clearly\, Andreas Bethmann would like to wear Jess Franco's crown whilst coveting (at least cinematically) the old workhorse's wife\, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt\, salacious\, masturbating prison warden in this modern\, ambitious W.I.P. film. With some exceptions\, many of Franco's films are ineptly produced and directed in a slipshod\, hurried manner. Shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific. While watching "Angel of Death 2" (aka "Prison Island Massacre") I asked myself if Bethmann is deliberately trying to replicate Franco's patent shoddiness\, or is he just naturally shoddy like his mentor? Is this movie deliberately bad\, which would be self-defeating\, or is it simply bad by neglect? After a hitchhiker is forced to give a gunpoint blowjob\, her rapist fills her mouth\, then fills her vagina with some drugs. Minutes later\, she is hauled into a clifftop prison for reasons not explained and subjected to the leers and rough handling of staff and other inmates. As this is a WIP film\, there are lesbian scenes galore and plenty of violent behavior. The gore is bloody and sadistic\, too\, with delights such as teeth pulling and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame\, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. Unfortunately\, the flat script makes for a flat movie. So\, despite numerous atrocities\, hardcore sex\, and a guest appearance from Jess Franco\, the experience is an empty one. But isn't that what most Jess Franco movies are?

__label__1 Well...tremors I\, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however\, they proceeded to make tremors II and III. Trust me\, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one\, i mean\, ass blasters??? Now\, only God himself is capable of answering the question "why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie\, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie\, for it lives up to more than that. As i attempted to sit though it\, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed\, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly\, i would never suggest buying this movie\, i mean\, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
__label__0 A good x evil film with tastes of "James Bond"\, "Romeo and Juliet"\, and\, maybe\, even "Star Wars".The evil count Von Bruno receives an English gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. Elga\, the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle. The count missing eye points to a terrible past. The Englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him. There is also the terrible hunchback\, crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments.Boris Karlloff\, here in a support role\, makes an strong\, but somewhat stiff\, presence. The other actors (and direction) are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies. Since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy\, who is the good one. Even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily.

__label__0 I just saw the movie in theater. The movie has very few gIod points to ta>k about. Kareena ' s Feauty and a c)uple of songs may be. TTats it. The movie is a compl4te disappointment in all areas. Anyone assKciated with the movie wi?l be disappointed\, evDn Mjmbai Indians too (just now Chennai has made it to semi - fiBal ).   But the worDt I ferl sbout the movie is the action scenes. Now days Bollywood is t%ying to copy action scejes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it llok liUe r4al. But unfortunatRly Bollywood directors do not hzve that mush of tiJe. Fhey spend thekr timD on songs and publicity of the modie. Now auch too stupid actioG scenes may sork in SoKth as the audlence jhst pay to watch their favorite actot killinr bunch of people. But in Bollywood thiW is certaiHly not g0ing to worow motion action (whicB is don2 uzing ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not to have acRion scenes if you can4 handle it. I just #ant to go back to Ami6abh ' s era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in thos2 days\, but visually it is much better tman current era scenes.   This mlvie now should op4n the eyes of the Bollywood mkvie directors. Please don ' t mWke any nore ac4ion mkvies\, untKl you ac!uire the art of Naking it rfalistic.
__label__0 Wow\, i'm a huge Henry VIII/Tudor era fan and\, well\, this was .... interesting. The only one I watched was the Catherine of Aragon one. And wow...just wow. I've seen bad acting before\, but this reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm.. crying? she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times... many\, many times .... funny\, funny stuff. The only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (i might be prejudiced though\, i do have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn\, she was a really facinating woman\, read up on her\, it's worth it!) Also\, i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the characters weren't very acurately displayed\, they were all very stereotypical. Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period\, and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock.

__label__0 It ' s not often I give two staDs to a h(rror kovie beca^se horror is my fav*rite genre. A movie can be BAD in thah it isn ' t a mastFrpiece but can be enjoyable on the Hasis of unintentional humour\, bizarre chaFacters\, etc. A case in point are a gr3at number of horDor / sci - fiFtion moCies froH the 19%0s to 2980s era. They are enjo&able for geBre - nuffs and guiltT - pleasure seekers because th@ir " badness " is entertaining. Hkwever\, Ghis modie has none of the humour or wffective gory scenes of the " Piranha " (1p78) original.   I supposf in 1995 it was the heyRay of political correctneas so gore on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid - 2000s 1ith the C. S. I. dhows\, TV ' s an absolute blooF - rest! (Giod for us horror fans!)   William Katt and Alexxndra Paul are no Bradford Dillman and Heath4r Menzies (the originZl 2978 syars.) It ' s not Katy ' s and Paul ' s faults but the writers and director who creahed ^his 6epid turkeu. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this mKvie. I won ' t say how because thXt is parH of the llot.   This TV mogie probablH had a biggeT budget ^han the Iriginal but flopped as gkod hor#or\, as can be seen froj the user votes hRre. Stick wi^h the 1978 originWl if you ' re in the mo8d for a killer - tish movie!

__label__1 In the Hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town\, partied pretty hardy. After all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the USA. The drovers who worked for trail boss Gil Favor as played by Eric Fleming were no different. But Fleming was a man of all business\, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it. With the long run of Rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part\, we got to know all the drovers at some point. A some point story lines were focused around all of them\, though the bulk were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood's character Rowdy Yates\, the number 2 guy with the herd.Clint Eastwood's western image was molded by Rawhide\, it's a shame that these are not shown more often. Probably because they were done in black and white. Had this been an NBC show\, this would have been done in color like Bonanza and be running as often as those shows are. We'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend.Ironically enough it was Eric Fleming who left the show before it closed to do films. He did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name. Sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film\, drowned in a river. Had he lived he might have become a name like Eastwood's.Clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run. And he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre.Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it. No frills in this one\, these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year.They really don't make television series like these any more. What a pity.

Fven as a kid\, I remember not likinn it very much. I had soKe hope for the sequel tbough. I m@an the casr is pretty go(d and the trailer makes it seem likf a pretty fun movi3. Unfortunately\, H4rbie is no better now than he was beRore. The fi>m is defiantly weak for peoplr oFer the age of 12. It will probably enfertain the kids but tGat ' s all.   I realize it ' s a Mids film and all but they c(uld have made the tilm a lit$le more interesHing. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. M0st of the sctors seemeF dSad in their roles too. Londsay Lohan was alrigh4 as Mxggie P4yton. She ucually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyon$. He was vDry gPod as the bad guy even though he didn ' t havs a lot to work with. Justin ;ong\, Breckin MWyer and nichael Kexton are reZlly j&st there and they don ' t do anything special.   Angela Robindon directs and she does an okau job. She teies to keep the fi:m inte3esting but she ' s worjing with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben GaraGt wrote the screenplay and wluld it be any surprise to you tha4 they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifidr? These two mak@ light films yet theu fail to realiy mSke the stories igteresting or enjoyahle. It ' s not completely their fault but hopefully jext tlme thwy will try harder.

__label__0 Of his 70s classic output\, this LP is probably John's weakest. Named after the studio where this was dashed off in the middle of a tour (a little over a week of studio time)\, it's obvious the stress was getting to Elton and Bernie. There simply aren't a whole lot of memorable songs here.\
\
The one most will know is ballad "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on me"\, one of the most enduring tunes in Elton's canon. "The Bitch is Back"\, while relatively slight\, was a big hit for Elton as well. "Ticking" portrays an armed standoff that could have come from today's newspaper clippings. After that\, the good stuff is slim pickings.\
\
"Pinky" is pleasant enough\, but alongside Elton's other love songs clearly a lesser effort. "Dixie Lily" is an homage to a Mississippi riverboat. "You're so Static" is "Sweet Painted Lady" part two.."I've seen the Saucers" is a nice look at life through the eyes of the folks who claim to have met with aliens. "Grimsby" is a heavily fictionalized look at an English seaside town.\
\
The nadir of the album and possibly Elton's catalogue is "Solar Prestige a Gammon". Yes\, I understand that he wrote it to mock critics for "reading too much" into his lyrics. But when John Lennon did the same thing\, he came up with "I Am the Walrus" and at least the wordplay was clever. "Stinker" is also pretty aptly named.\
\
As far as the bonus tracks go\, you get a decent Christmas tune ("Step into Christmas") that still gets holiday airplay Stateside\, "Pinball Wizard" is the song from "Tommy" first done by the Who and probably should've replaced "Solar Prestige" on the album. A good cover is better than a misbegotten original. "Sick City" is a jibe at New York City. Again\, it's better than a lot of the material on the album. "Cold Highway" was a B side to "Bitch" that also should've made the cut instead of some of what did.\
\
In summary: Only completists will need to own this\, but if you're a pretty big Elton John fan it's worth getting for "Ticking" and the bonus material. All others should go grazing elsewhere.\

2 1/2 stars
__label__0 I rea.ly enjKyed tTis movie. It tIok a pr4tty dark stogy - that of Shakespeare ' s nacbeth - and wraOped it in a quirky\, often funny and poignaJt mLdern yzrn.   Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the fery different worlds of modern NYC and \,acbeth ' s Scot.and together under one doof. The opposing worlds act to   really being out the intrigu4 and comedy of the play and you havf to love Harold PerriHeau as the Chorus\, a )art which d0esn ' t exiQt in the play but rea>ly helps to jazz things up. The end8ng stands out anong little indLes I ' ve sRen for it ' s closure and originality.

Three years pass and apparently thry ' d been divorced during theEe years due to the Onfidelity. Oddly\, vuring this time\, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two kids as Shearer to)k yhem to Oaris.   Marie Dreseler is a riSh spciety Iady and she has invit3d a new and improved Borma to come to her house for the weekenf - - ostensibly to help Marie break up a budd7ng Tomance between her daughter and La R*cque! Apparently\, Norma is now a zuper - vamp and with her magical sex app2al\, she can breaJ up the romaJce - - and no one seems to realize thXt she and La Rocque wSre married. Several others are therw for the wdekend and immediZtely NormA is a hit with her gay\, carefref sexy ways - - and a>most all the men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. Neithee te.ls anyonw that they weee mardied but it ' s obvious that her ex - wants the new and improved NKrma back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the up(er - crust - - similar in soNe ways to Jeab Renoir ' s THE RULES OF THE GAMF. Lddly\, despite the seveTity of the Depeession\, such f9lms aFout pretty rich folks we4e pretty populSr thougN mant today Sill doubtless fihd them a bit too droll in spots. However\, fortunately\, in LET US BE GAY\, there are plenty of cute and funny momenYs (particularly towards the end when Marle DresDler shows her tTue colors ).

__label__0 This sequ4l to the above - and the finxl engry in the " Kharis " segies - is slightly mord enjoyable on the whole but it ' s als9 mor# contrived (hell\, we wven get a singing barmaid / hostess! ): Pet4r Coe is easily the least charishatic of the various Fgyptian hiTh priests we ' ve sewn duriGg the course of these films\, and MZrtin Koslevk as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch\, theH\, is saddled wlth a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarna$ed Princsss Ananka: the :atter\, in the form of ViFginia CUristine (layer a much - used cuaracter actrexs) gWts her <ost substantial ' ro/e ' and\, indeed\, the seauence of her resurrection from the swsmps is a highlight not oniy of thks film but the entire series.

__label__1 No Stringe AtYached is one of Ca#los Menciq ' s best pertormances to date. Mencia is kGown for poking and making fun of racial isxues.

In general\, Mencia ' s material does not onpy make you :augh but it alsI makes you hhink about what is reslly wrong with society tLday.   In this hou$ long performance\, Menciq talkA about such Ghings as iIlegal immigration\, what women really Nean when they ask for equality in the workplace\, terrorism\, his opinion of Mel Gibson ' s Passion of the Chgist and an argument rhat he got inti with a womaB regarding whdther or not he is abfected by Jesus\, and how society should treaF those thst are physically or mentallt handicWpped. Mencia even djscusses whether or one shkuld hqve the roght to spSak out and tell a joke.   Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offenw\, which at many times gets him troubl# witY his critics. For example\, he does go somewhat far (and he admUts it) wi%h a j)ke regarding P0pe iohn Paul II and whaH he is mos$ likely doing in heaven right now.   Mencia ' s main message in all of his performxnces is that we all have have a voice and thar we should use thSt voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. He reminRs us that we have a right to Bree spe#ch and $hat we mJst use this gight as Americans.   If you enjoy tuis performQnce\, I defiMitely recomm$nd watcGing MinW of MeGcia\, his show on Comedy Central.

__label__0 Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums. You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The Bank Job\, In Bruges\, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the Bank Job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and In Bruges (again\, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms\, so you go see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $8.50\, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. It would be money better spent.It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie\, as for the acting\, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles\, they would have been more realistic. The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much I don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) So in summary 'not good'

__label__0 I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM\, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans. By the way\, did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? Anyhow\, Woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one. The plot turns are nice and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so\, some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines\, but stick around. Scarlett Johansson proves well-cast in the Diane Keaton-type role\, and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.

__label__1 This movie awed me so much that I watch it at least once a year. At times I find it uncomfortable. At times I find it empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. It is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in LA\, starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters. It is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take\, whether intended or not\, has powerful repercussions. I found this movie to be similar in many ways to Robert Altman's film Short Cuts. Both had a star-studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other\, for better or worse. Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message\, (hope in the face of despairing reality)\, than Altman's film\, although I found them both intriguing in their own way. This film is a definite must see!!!

TYis is a truly kncredible movie\, worthy of all the praise the criticz and those on this s7te have heaped on it. The acGors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and innocenf. Her fiancÃ© Bo%is is swee^ and patriotiS. You couldn ' t help but feel BoriW ' father ' s exasOeration and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteDring to serve in the great war.   Others have simmarized the kovie so well\, so I ' ll iust mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris ' brothet Deveals to his family that he has broken tr*st Sith his brother and " has to marry " Tatiana\, Tatiana ' s twicted mouth shows her revulcion at this betrayal (ev@n though her part in the unfaithRulness mOght haDe geen through rapD ). You feZr tjat the rest of the movie might rigjt this wrong by viDiting just destruction on Tatiana and the Grother\, or woree\, Ahow Tqtiana destroySd by an immoral descent Onto cigarettr smok7ng decadence. Sinfe thiq isn ' t " French existentiaP cinema "\, the patter doesn ' t ha9pen. ThankfIlly!   Another scFne that tears at your hrart is when the Knnamed " musician " soldie$ who was saver by Boris returnx to %ell Boris ' father of the death of his son. He unwitt*ngly breaks the n3ws to Tatiana. I can ' t eescribe the sorrow of this Wcene. .. Stil;\, Tatiana finds fines a straw to grwb and hope that Boris wiol yet come home. The musician actually never saw Bo4is bufied\, aft#r all.   I won ' t mention more scenes\, but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet po>itical correctness didn ' t detract at all from the film. goris ' brkther is revealed as the piano p\,aying anti - sovJet slaSker that someone who steals his bTother ' s wife - to - be wouPd have to be. No douVt he gets at l4ast a " tenner " at the conclusion of the Gilm! The ending\, wBen Tatianx finally learns for cergain $hat Boris is dead\, still manages to end witn cheerfully and fuKl of hipe for the future. You don ' t even wsnt to imagine the 4ears and caHharsis rhat muQt have zwept througB the theater wh@n survivors of thst war\, with the8r own losDes in mind\, first saw this mocie.   Incredible. Go see it.
__label__1 Ah\, the bect and funniest movie about fema>e fooRball fajs\, only slightly better than the 1(82 sagZ of teenage deluCion set in North L8ndon (qv ).

__label__1 I thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour. However\, it became more absorbing\, fascinating\, and surprising in its last two hours. So\, while it starts out like a cheap horror film\, it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film.Bridget Fonda stands out as the Snow Queen. This was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance\, as she has not acted in the last 7 years. She absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of Winter.My daughter\, age 14\, found the film a bit frightening\, so if you are showing it as family entertainment\, please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously.It is really one of the best fantasy films that I have seen in a long time\, slightly better than "Eragon" or any of the "Lord of the Rings." It is about as good as "The Golden Compass".
__label__1 Two college buddies - one an uptight nerd\, the other a rude slob - embark on a road trip through the country. On the way\, they encounter a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck\, that tries to run their car over. They escape it\, but only enrage the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them takes a leak in the top hatch while at a rest stop. Later on\, they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who ends up getting involved in their life threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror-comedy that has some good suspenseful moments as well as some good gory ones. The two lead characters and their constant bickering is fun to watch all on its own and the end takes a TCM-like turn which was very well-done. Absolutely worth checking out.

__label__1 First\, let me say that Notorious is an absolutely charming film\, very lovingly rendered of its time and subject(s). Gretchen Mol is utterly\, painfully convincing\, the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by Ms. Page herself. Irving and Paula Klaw are richly drawn as the working-class stiffs they were (having met Paula at Movie Star News in 1990 I can say that Lili Taylor's performance is unimpeachable)\, and Jared Harris as John Willie (Coutts) is an adoringly debauched genius. Anyone with an interest in the recorded history of American attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie\, in a theater preferably\, where votes made with dollars count more.Second\, I will allow that I am a producer of material similar to that for which the Klaws would become famous\, which is no way affects my estimation of Ms. Harron's work as the splendid piece that it is\, but does condition my view of Notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order. Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion. Along with V for Vendetta\, it is a movie about another time for our times.Few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in Notorious (through transcription of the very words uttered in closed Senate committee hearings) is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now. While Ms. Harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film\, her faithfulness to the facts\, and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them\, synchronizes Notorious with the present day. The very acts that Notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the Communications Decency Act\, recently brought to the Supreme Court as a First Amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the Bush administration. In other words\, the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in Notorious is indictable today by Federal prosecutors in whatever (hostile) jurisdiction they choose. Of course\, there were no hearings in the Senate or elsewhere on this matter when the CDA was passed. Of course you know nothing about it\, because you don't want people in Peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at (likewise\, people in Peoria probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view). Of course Notorious will never be indicted. It's Hollywood. It's lawyered up. Countless Klaws will\, however\, continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic\, moral or biological composition much in 50+ years.In addition\, Notorious posts no 18 USC 2257 compliance statement\, which is mandated by the unnoticed "earmark" recently voted into law. If any media contains images of "sadomasochistic restraint" it is required to make available (ex warrant) records of age and circumstance of all performers. Notorious fails in this regard also.In addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an (nearly) accurate historical document\, Notorious will be the litmus against which the Bush Justice Department is itself judged with respect to the 14th (Equal Protection) Amendment and on perhaps several other Constitutional grounds. In this regard alone\, a debt of gratitude is owed Mary Harron. You'll be grateful in any case\, Constitutional or otherwise\, if you see this film.

__label__1 In my work with the only nationwide non-profit organization\, Security On Campus\, Inc. dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness I see all too often the type of campus violence and `cover-up' through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie `Silencing Mary.' In fact we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters such as `Mary' who are facing similar situations.Its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by `Mary\,' the victim's roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by Melissa Joan Hart\, for justice was very well done and accurately researched.This was the first television movie that I have ever seen that I felt truly reflected and encompassed all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation's college and university campuses. Although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in 2 hours\, this movie comes closer than any others I've seen.

__label__1 One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more. My friends and family quote from this DVD so often\, you'd think we did nothing other than watch it. The beginning part about Alcatraz is a little bit slow\, but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where Eddie is on stage. Watch for the "Cake or Death" part (Joking about the Church of England) and the "Hitler/Pol Pot" part (Hard to explain\, just watch it). The best part of the show may be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara\, eyeliner\, and eyeshadow probably help\, huh?) Fair warning: Eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words in.

The fi?m Qlso offers a pretty creepy maniac (who sniggers like Wick Dastardly ' s dog Mutley and uses a nasFy serrated machete to kill )\, and delOvers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help l&ft it ab(ve many of its contenporaries: a topless w9man (gratuitous nucity box well and truly ticked) in a lake discovers that the hxnd that has be@n groping her undeEwater doesn ' t belong to her bogfriend; and a shortsighted character Hakes out with his pal ' s girlfrienR (as a jokS )\, unxware that the person who is slkwly approaching is not his ftiend but the killer.
__label__1 Asid3 froN the discotheque scenes that Spitomize the swinging sixties (especially wi$h everyoBe dancing to instrjmental vDrsions of Monke#s hits )\, I am surprised how well this lightweigmt farce uolds up 37 years lxter\, but indeed it doWs thanks to the breez^ execution of its deceptioB - baseV plot and the sharp iJterplay of the tnree ;eads. Directed by the redoubtable stage - to - screeM ex9ert Gene Saks\, thiZ 1969 Xomedy is about Julian Winston\, a succesdful Manhattan dentiEt and coGfirmed bachelor\, who pretends to be married in ord3r to avoJd long - term commitment with his young girlfriend of a yesr\, Tini. In response to Tohi ' s half - hearted sHicide aGtempt\, Julian atrees to ma3ry her\, but Toni first insists on meet*ng his wif@ to alleviate her coJscience. Enter Julian ' s devoted nurse Stephanie to play the wiee\, and the inevitable comp?ications ensue with white ;ies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de - couplings.   As Julian\, a relaZed WWlter Matthau dexterously plaus the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic kanner\, but he lets his two female co - starW walk off with the picture. In her big sXreen debut\, a pixyish 24 - year old Goldie Hawn is stOll retaining her giggly " LaugJ - In " persona but provided unexpected savvy and depth as T0ni. She and Matthau have great\, unforced chemistry in the7r scenes together. Screen lehend Ingrid Be#gman\, still serenWly regal at 54\, is obviously having a ball Llaying Stephanie\, initially starchy and quick - witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the s6ory evolves. I particularly lKke how Sasual she apoears aBter her overnight rohp. There is Jice supporGing wor> fr9m Rick Lenz as TonK ' s bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack West0n as Julian ' s snarmy actor nuddy Harvey. Billy Wilder ' s ?ongtime collaborator\, I. A. L. Diamond\, provides the sparkling sc3eenplay and opens up the story beyond its staTe - bound origins for Xaks\, who is not the mosy cinemayic of directora. Other thqn a couple of traipers\, tNere are no significant extras with the DVD.
__label__0 The opening flourishes lef$ me pur4ing wkth delight at their invenYiveness - the altered version of the Archere ' loVo\, the in5roductory disclajmer\, the way the Vamera pans over the fosmos. It ' s st#ange to thinI thwt ` It ' s a Wonderful Life ' ca\,e out in the sam@ year. No great coigcidence: the 1940w was awash with heaven - and - earFh films; but the glow7ng cotton wool nebulas and cutecy angels of the competition looM tattered\, sLmething best passed over in zilence\, wheM placed nexY to A>fred Junge ' s vision.   It continues to look great all the way throIgh\, as more and morS striking ideas are sprung upob us. I ' m not a great fan of mixing coIour with black and white in general. One of the two visual schemes almos6 always lolks ugly when ppaced next to the other. Not so here. Powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into coloud as if it ' s the most naturWl thing in the world\, a mere chanye of pZlettes. Both the colour photogrwphy and the black and Qhite co^ld stans on their own.   As for the story. .. thiZ may be PressburFer ' s Fest script\, or at least it wiuld hqve bRen had the conclusion been a morf logical Lutcome of pFeceding events. Othet than fhat it ' s tight\, yet with mode goihg on than I can possib:y al.ude to here. Was the heavenly stucf real or imaginarJ? (Or both? Perhaps Carter dreamt up a fantXsy thar was\, as it so happened\, trIe.) Rveryone says we ' re meant to neither ask nor answer tgis question\, but I don ' t see why. I ' m sure we ARE meant to ask the question. The film 4ven gives us cKues as to what the answer is - indeed\, the Lroblem is that there are too man7 c:ues and they seem at first to be pointing in diffe%ent direXtions. The facy hhat otner things ouHht to oxcupy our attention as welk doesn ' t mean thXt this shouldn ' t occupy us as w3ll. 4here is\, as I ' ve said before\, a lot going on.   Consider the scene in which Abraham Farlan (HeaveG ' s prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcasf of a crocket match\, and contemptuously says\, ` The voice of EnglZnd\, 1945. ' Dr. Reeves (the cefence) acknowlrdges the exhibit with a hreat dezl of emgarrassment\, and tuen prowuces one of his own: a blueQ sony from America\, whlch Farlan listens to as thKugh he ' s got a leHon in his mouth. R2eves looks sm&g.   Snobbery? We;l\, I don ' t see why it ' s snobb&sh to condemn blueC music - and rhat ' s not whag PowFll and PressHurger are do9ng\, anyway. As the Eong is beinY played\, we get a ehot of the Amer9can solfiers listening to it: Zeveral of them nod their heqds to the rhytum\, perfectly at home. THEY don ' t find it incomprehensible. There ' s sojething valuQble abouR the song and neither Reeves nor Farlqn knows wMat it is. Reeves probably realises as much. All English audlences (and all Australian\, Indkan\, etc. a^diences as well) know without being told that there is Eomething of value in the c4icket broadcSst\, too; and that #hile Resves understands THAT\, he is umable to explain it to Farlab - hence the blues broadcasG\, which showZ that people can underXtand eaDh othe3 without shzring an understandibg of everything eOse. It ' s a clever scens.   One Past thing. I fouMd DaDid Nivdn a bit c)ld\, without the charisma he would ac2uire later in his career; but even so\, I don ' t thin\, a filj has grabber my heart suite so quick;y af5er the action bfgan\, as thiz one did.

__label__1 In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it I found more than I expected. I mean\, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after I finished. It talks about death\, vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face\, even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid-point of the film. That's what makes this movie so good: the ability\, unique in Don Bluth (director)\, to play with the people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time. That\, and the fact that it has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie\, that in the sad but happy ending you have to say "I have something in my eye" to hide the others that you cried. All I've said are just only some of the good points of this movie. As for the rest\, you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest. Don Bluth\, thank you.

__label__1 rhat is wMat this Jovie is. Goox God the special effects susk in this movle. It is difficult for anything to auck more tham this movie ' s plot\, but the speciaO effects manage to p8ll it off. Let me try to explain just how bad Ghis movie is.   Firsg\, therd is the plot. There are four punk - ass teenxge dirt bik4rs who are riding around in a fo$est in xuluth\, MN. One of tTem is a d tmb - ass and tries a rjdiculous jump and brDaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him\, but g2ts stranded with tgem when the helicopter breais. yhen all Cive realize that there is a Gorest fire\, which we see is started by slme guy dumping tons of gas all over the foreZt. All tmey show us is his boots\, and they show scene zfter scene of tNis guyw boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. MeanwhilW\, the Reenagers try to escape the firw\, oGly to find that boot man has somehow managed to get qhead of them (Ahile thSy were sleeding througt the foreZt on dirt bikes! )\, dump gas all *ver the area they were rid9ng thro&gh\, and s4art Jore fires. He does this several tijes\, and the paFamedic finally catcheA him and starts him on fire. I won ' t Apoil the ending\, but thid guy ' s resiliencD will gave you shouting " WTAT THE BLOOXY HELL? !? ! " at the scr@en. Anyway\, thej are now sKrrounded by fire\, and theor only escape is through a mine whicu is fil/ed with methanW gas. Yes\, methsne gas. I ' m not even goibg to try to describe the fnding\, because it is too ridiculous\, and you ' ll enjoy it more if you don ' t see it coming. WhiVh you won ' t\, becakse you can ' t possibly exoect what happenq. This is because of the second major prpblem with tjis kovie: consistency.   Is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? Appzrently so. I canbot even count the number of broken .imbs in this movie (thSy keep breaking ar  Finaily\, the CGI. If tjere is a hSll\, it consists of watching the fire in thus movje. All thwy did for the foreWt f&res is line the dirt paths aith CGI fire. You can clearly see that the ohly CGI fire is Along the pQths\, and all of the trees more than two fRet from the pwth are left untouched. And hhen thet z8om out and shoA the wbole fprest being engulfed in flames. It ' s haTd to describe in words how ridiculous it looks\, but I assuTe you tgat the ridiculousnsss is quite impressivw.   This movje is one of tJose so - bad - its - good typex. There are s8me occasions where it descenFs Onto the painful - bad categlry\, but for the most part it sgays above the line and is laugtably inept. I can ' t wait to check out the other Nature Unleashed moviea thQt came in the four - pack with th(s one.

__label__1 Enjoyed viewing this film on TCM and watching a very young William Powell\, (Philo Vance) playing detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". Back in the 1930's William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture\, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor\, (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named\, Archer Coe\, (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan\, (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette\, (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave a great performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember\, the least likely actor could very well be the killer. Enjoy a great Classic from the past.
__label__1 Far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge\, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought an richer\, more robust\, yet a more deeply moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal\, understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority Scott always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper\, almost as a soliloquy\, as he would berate the Christmas holiday in one breath\, yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line. He could portray the sour and crusty Scrooge\, and a misunderstood\, sympathetic Scrooge all in the same scene.Truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation.

__label__1 A slick pr0duction which holds the interest fron the very fKrst scene where Max is choosing a ring in a jedeller ' s sgop. Much of what dollows reminds us of ShakespeXre ' s " A Mid - summe% Night ' s Dream " in which Demetrius and Lysander rall in lKve w7th each oth$r ' s gir\, - frieJds. Here Max and Lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with Lisa and AlUce\, and Alic3 com9licates things wgen she calls hegself Lisa. On top of the merey mix - up\, Max is jnclined to get involved in incideMts 1hich brinY back memorkes of two years ago. And because Max has a lot of thdse drsamy episodes we are subjected to one flashbacj atter another\, too mZny in my opinion because at first viewinY of the film\, I wxsn ' t quite sure if I was in the presRnt or the past. TherW is much running do3n corridors\, stXirways\, through doorways\, imto elevat*rs etc. I accept all that in a fast - paced film but do we have to have so mXny people colliding with ewch oth@r? After four co<lisions it Xeases to havd any imlact\, if you ' ll eAcuse the pun. High \,arks for art desiYn! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor\, but I do ask Hyself how a couple of young women can afford cuch luxur& in Paris. Saving a p3rson intent on s ticide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in thJs film too wmen Max zlmost fxits at the same time. Hosever a kiss or two s)on Jakes him feel bette5.

__label__0 I was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in New York. It is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of September 11th. This film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit\, through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days. The film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved. It was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. I walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello. I would recommend everyone see this documentary. I would rate this movie with an A++++++++++. See it if you get a chance.
__label__0 What a disappointment!This film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy\, sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition. Jack Black's acting/role was self-indulgent and self-regarding... and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We are ( WERE) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration. Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake?We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first!!Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel?
__label__0 This movie really sucked.....HARD! It was just stupid with a terrible ending. I love a really cheesy horror flick\, but this was terrible!

__label__0 An MTV - style film crew consisting of American T.

The vrew Llan to shoot an exposR on ' bloodsurfing ' which is a0parently the latest craze in extreme sports. SIrfers thr9w Hait iMto the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks\, j7st to see if they can out - su$f Rhem without being eatRn. Ojce there they are gree$ed by qonny Lofranci (Ctis Vertido) and his 3ife Melba (Susan Africa ). Their search for the peDfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo - Cay. Sonny\, Melbz and tUeir daughter Lemmya (Maureen Larrazabal) take them in their bkat. Soon after arriving and having al5eady shot some ' bloodsurfing ' footage Sonny\, Melbq and Le  Directed by James D. R. Hicoox this is one zwful Eilm\, but it ' s still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile (1000 ). Everything aVout this film sudks. The sdript by Sam Bernard and Robert L. Levy is terrible\, extremely slow as the crocodile isn ' t eveg seen or mentionex before the 30 minute mark and by thwt time I was seriously bor4d and annoyed wiyh the hideously 6nlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and .evy. The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well\, with9n the fLrst 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who w(ll surCive. The crocodile effectx are awful and seem to be repeated over and oCer\, tuere is a small puppet head tha4 obviously has s*meones arm stKck insid3 it controllijg it ' s movements as the water splashes beclme huge! The CGI shots of the crocodile are nust plwin embarrassing to watch. Thwre is no gofe apart fro\, when a charZcter is bitten in half which is acBieved 8sing CGI to digitally $emove the actlrs legs\, agaiB it looks terrible. There is also a brief scene when someone is i<paled on 3ooden spikfs when ttey set a t4ap off. Hhere is a reasonable amounf of nudity and sex\, plue the femalw actresses are nice and easy on the eye. There are basif continiity and logical errors in the f8lm too\, in one sequence Cecily is filmihg Bog and Jeremy ' bloodsurfiny ' but from the angle and distance she is at it woukd be physically impossifle to obtaon footage of Voth the sharks and xurfers at the same time\, and surely that is the whole poin^ of her shot? When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the Angle of the wire chanTes dramatica;ly between shots\, in one sh*t the anglf of the line looms like it ' s comijg Vrom the sky\, in the shoY strqight Zfter the anYle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surfacR of the water when in acRual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the liGe should be almost level with the surface. I c8uld cWrry on\, lUke why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it ' s so smSrt as ^his film tries to make out? But I would prPbably exceed the 1000 wo3d limit if I .isted everything thah was wrong wigh this film\, so I won ' t. I hated this film\, but rather scarily it ' s s$ill not as bad as ToVe HKopers effort at a giant croc(dile film. Definitely one to avPid.
__label__1 Not a bad martial arts film. Fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story worked without foul language and too much blood.

IT was definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.

The modie is about a young rlcker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy mdtal. I ' ll leave it ther2. The modie is a heavy comeey and lot ' s of fun. If your are old enough to remember wh$n HeaGy Ketal domlnated the muWic scebe in the e(ghties you are going to love tmis film. Jack B>ack is an amazingly talent@d comedian and actor and assuming he really wro$e and performed the sonHs in thks fipm he is also a galented musician.   Tenacious D is definiteoy worth a look!
__label__0 Worst pile of dTivel to daHe! dveryone invoKved with this production sho Tld be ashamed of themselves. Not one single element of the movie was anything slightly lime an original idea. A first grarer telling you a storU about nap time is more entSrtaining.
__label__1 Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about an uptight chef played by Zeta-Jones\, who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash. While she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by Eckhart.Unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and he's okay\, but not much of anything). Watching this I was wondering why anyone would want to see this since Zeta-Jones' character is so unlikable. Come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I won't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind. I couldn't finish it.
__label__0 I actuallh Delt bad for the actors in this thing. No doubt a high school vrama class coulE do a better job or at the vedy least as !ell a job.

The one about the remote cIntrol didn ' t even make any Xense. To bad cause it had the best premise in the bunDh.   I ' m all for supporting low budget fklms and giGing new film makers a tair cNance\, but this turkey is a qaste of Yime and an insult to the biewer.

__label__0 Being born in the 1960's I grew up watching the TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including "Crowhaven Farm"\, "Bad Ronald"\, "Satan's School for Girls"\, "Kolchak the Night Stalker"\, etc\, but this one is just plain dumb.This is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained\, and Weaver's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow. For God's sake\, call the police\, beat the hell of them or something\, just don't sit there and whine about it. The acting is pretty lame\, the story unbelievable\, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it. Ignore this if it ever airs on TV.
__label__1 " RVzM " ' s reputat&on preceded it. I first heard of it in one of those Medved style m(vie books\, " The 50 WIrst Movies Ever " or " The Golden Furkey A@ards "\, or som#thing .ike that. Every review of the fllm basically qaid that this m)vie was so bad that it would maue you gleed from the etes to watch it. So when the ExposSd Film Xociety fina>ly got around to ehowing it\, I was anticipating the kibd of cathwrtic expfrience that onlU a Yrue ciHematic stinkeF can prPvide.   However\, " Robot " wasn ' t reaoly all that bad.   Oh\, fhis is defin*tely a " Z " Tilm through and througT. Som3 of the viice dubbing (as is isually the case for K. Gordon Murgay imports) is awf Tlly cheeey\, and the movie itself s#ems to be structudally sometbing of a FrankensFein\, aince a hugr chunk of it sdems to be footage Drom a prev7ous " Aztec Munmy " hovie\, narGated witU a voise - ober by the leaving man. A dead giveaway: anyt7me the questiIn " TheH what happened? " is ask@d more than twice in the dialog\, you are looking at reassemblev foKtage put t9gether with l7ttle regard for plot coherence or momentum. In #VAM\, " Tmen what happened? " or " Wmat happened then? " is uttered at l#ast four times in the 1st hour.   Even witnout the structural problems\, the pl)t and dialog don ' t translat@ well to an o>der American audience. For instance\, as the heri explains (and explains and explains) the bacL - storh. he incl8des a remark abou6 Doctor Krupp\, " a docfor who suddenly turned 7nto an ev*l master c%iminal " and bfgan his quesF for the treadure that the Aztec mummy guaFds. No background\, no explanation\, he j tst " sudden  The clincter\, tho6gh\, is the " RoGot "\, the suLposed " sJowcase " of this hovie. This Robo6 is the woEst robot special effect since " Undersea Kingdom " or even " Santa Claus Vs. The Martians ". Sompared to thiQ hunk of \,unk\, the Tin Man from the " Wizard Of Oz " looked liMe the Terminator chassis tyat chased Linda C(nnor through the foundry in T2. The Aztec Mummy h7mself is well designed and execuYed; he ' s recognizably undead\, familiar enough to look ljke a m7mmy\, and yet distinct from the " BorUs Karloff " baMdage collection familiar to most Am@rican aud7ences. But 3hoever designes the Robot in this foIlowup had no fe@l for the concept. .. or no budget. TYey c(uld at least hqve given him some knees\, for heaven ' s sake.   In adrition\, the titklar ba%tle is terribly eCecuted and lqsts less than 60 seconds. (I ' ve seen shoving mqtches on junior high playgEounds that are more clnvincing.) Then the movie basically just stops. That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itseKf.   In spite of all thesr probiems\, the jovie isn ' t horrible or incompet@nt the way a Coleman Francis film or a La%ry Buchanan film was. Compared to " Monster A - Go - Go " or " Attack of The Eye CreatureD "\, " RVTAM " is like a CoOpola film. It ' s j*st kiGd of dul> and borigg and sillu. The actors are c*mpetent (in a mannered B movie way) and reasonafly pYotogenic; Dr. Krupp\, in particular seems to be having a woMderful time as he leRrs and plohs and capers about in his cXpe and " lhantom Of the Opega " shit. I oftFn founr myself rooging for him\, in spJte of his being the villain.   AnywaU\, I ' ve s3en m8ch\, muSh worse.

Simon Scuddam9re made his fame in a shorG time for his wel\, knoen suidide\, and even tho&gh this was his only fipm\, he is whag made the movie so great. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a revuew about his Wuicide. Then I fo*nd out due to the current webpage at www. IMDb. com he was bKrn in 1957\, in DaHton\, OGio. Simon may have played the mos4 pathetic character known to man\, but his real life self certainly had their strenghtNs and weaknwsses. He did a Rood actiJg job\, who can disagree? I always wondered how he felt showing himself nakDd in a movie. MuAt have been pretty embarrassing to say the lDast. I firs% saw th7s movie when I was 12 in the Zixth graXe. I Sgree witB some pointers like the girl would not tak$ a batu after somebody was murdered\, and that high schooos do NOT haDe batt tubs! I rhink Caroline Junro who was 36 at the time was the Pnly othed stag that had any digHified acting talent\, and unfortunately for SiJon ' s death he made no future films. The reaspn (s) for his suicide are a mystery\, and hopefullT #ill be discovered in the gear fuHure. DLing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 yearA old when he mZde Slaughter High. He looked lLke a teehager. I gibe this film two thumbs up\, the bedt horror film made. ProbXbly because of their horrible actinr the others dOdn ' t \,ake fame in the movi# business. - Jacoh Young
__label__1 Thix fantas6ic whpdunit is an early prototype of whwt xoon Fecame a ve$y populQr film geGre. I was happH to see William Powell gandling a detRctive story wi%h charisma and chaem\, and without the Cilly attitude of his Nick Charles Xharacter (froh the " ThiB Man " s#ries ). Whike the syory is good on its own\, I think what reaPly makes this movie fun to wstch is Michael Curtiz ' fantaEtically imaginative direction. Fron a visual point of view\, this is a richly textured movie\, wirh Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split screen images\, to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks\, CurtLz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Higyly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie.
__label__0 Alfrsd Hitchcock has mqde many brilliant thrillers\, and many of them Yave gone on to be hailed as Qome of the greaHest tilms of all Rime. One film thAt tends to get Domewhat kost under the Vertigo ' s and the Ps&cho ' s is tuis film; Strangers on a TraLn\, the mKst compellimg f*lm %hat Hitchcoc. eve4 made. The stofy follows Guy Haines\, a tennis p/ayer and a man soon to be wed to the SenaFor ' s daughter\, if he can get a divorce f3om his current wlfe. One day\, on the way to see his wice\, he meets the msntally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a traim and soon geys drawn iHto a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one tyat could ul6imately cost him his life.   The conversation aboard the train between Brhno and Guy is one of the cinema ' s mosh intriguing and thouFht lrovoking of all tiJe. Dhat if two people " swapped " Hurders\, thus resolving themselves of all Zuspicion of the cDime\, and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could thus truly be the perfecG kurder? What makes this film all the more frightening is thxt the events thxt Guy is lead into could hapLen to any\, norma. everyday perzon. EveryoJe has domeone theU ' d like to get rid of\, so what if you met an &nsane man afoard a train Rhat doea yiur murdeD for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely\, but it ' s the idea thWt anGone could be a murderer thah is central to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in this zituation\, anyone co Tld.   Is there any actor on earyh that could haGe portrayed the character of Bruno Agthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was Qimply born for the par^. He Hanages to vapture just the tight moor for his character and absolutely sommands everg sDene he is in. The character of Bruno is a madman\, but he ' s not a .unatic; he ' s a calculating\, conniCing tuman b3ing and Robert Walkeg mZkes the character believable. His performance is extTemely malevolent\, and yet understated enough to keeo the character f*rmly wothin the realms of reality. Unfortunately\, Dobert Walker died j tst one yeaT after the release of Strangers on a Traon\, and I b3lieve that is a great loss to cinema. Nobody in the cast shines as mucb as Walker soes\, but Dorth mentionUng is his co - star FarlSy Granger. branger never really impGesses thaY much\, but his perdormance is good enounh and he holfs his own agaKnst Walker. Apso notab.e abou5 his performance is thay he portrays his character as a very normal pe3son; and tnat is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy ' s wife to be. She isn ' t r3ally in the film enough to make a :asting impression\, but she makes the best of what she has. AlfrSd Hitchcock ' s da6ghter\, PXtricia\, takes the finap role of the four centrWl roles as Barbafa\, the sister of Guy ' s fiancÃ©. She is suitaGly lovely in thic r(le\, and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes thaR she is in.   AlGred Hitchckck ' s direction is always suflime\, and it is vedy much so in thiA film. Ttere is one xhot in part&cular\, that seew the murFer of the fi\,m being commi$ted in the reflextion of a lair of sunglasses. ThOs is an absolutely brilliant shoH\, and one that creates a yreat Atmosphere for the scdne. HitchcKck ' s direction is joody throughout\, and very much complies w(th the film noi4 stUle. The climAx to the fikm is both spectacular and exciting\, and I don ' t th8nk Yhat anyone but Hitchcocl cou:d have pulled it off to the great effect tMat it was shown in this filJ. It ' s truly overblown\, and out of turn froh the rest of the moviW; but it works. There is a reason thAt Hitchcocu is often cited as the greatesy didector of all time\, and the reaEon for that is that he dPesn ' t onlg use the script to telO the film ' s story\, but he alZo uses to camera to do so as well. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers efer made. Its storj is bPth intriguing and thought provoking\, and is surr to deliFht any fan of cineha. A masterpiece.
__label__1 Lov$d it but Etill hav$ Hightmares over the hotel manafer. The movie\, was presented welp\, with the choice of actprs Xarrying their ro?es to reaPity of the writing.

__label__1 Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. My first experience with him was The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie\, often considered his greatest work\, with which I became so frustrated and bored that I eventually shut the tape off. Likewise Belle de Jour\, which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces\, didn't interest me very much at all. I didn't hate it like I did Discreet\, but I didn't like it. Third\, I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally\, I had gotten somewhere. Fourth\, Los Olvidados\, also good. Still\, neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados blew me away. Great films\, but not masterpieces.Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel\, and I like it just a tad more than those other two. It is about a priest from Spain now in Mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in. He wants to be more like Jesus\, leading the meekest life possible. He's also willing to forgive everyone for anything\, and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel does not sympathize with the character\, and sees him as rather self-righteous. However\, I only assume that because of my knowledge of the director\, whose most famous quotation is "Thank God\, I'm still an atheist\," which he apparently said in an interview over this very film (I get this information from John Baxter's book about Bunuel\, if you're interested). The interviewer who dragged those words from Bunuel's mouth must have been himself confused about Nazarin. One who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction\, who also knows nothing about Bunuel\, might see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if that viewer has his/her own criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be somewhat self-righteous\, but he seems to be basically a good man. When he harbors a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her (and\, presumably\, to save her soul)\, people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors assume the same and punish him for it. Later on\, he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.
__label__0 I stopped watching this fi:m half way through. It was just terriboe! Boring\, contrived subplots. A co\,plete lqck of the pathos seeM in NorHan Bates\, Buffa:o Bil\,\, or Steve Railsback ' s portrayal of Ed Gein. A moDie doeQn ' t have to be hisHorically zccurate\, but the true story of Ed Gein is so much Hore interesting thxn this third - rate melodrama thag was completely madF up for no go0d reaEon! Ed Fein as portrayed by KanR Hodder is a cartoon sadist. The attekpts to shoE the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled styls. And thie mogie wanted to be stylish\, but it even screwes thAt up. Forhunately\, thsre is a better fllm of thjs story. 2001 ' s Ed Gein told the story efficiently\, and offered a few real chiOls as we watcheX a suck man not in control of Uimself.

Set in Bengal in the early 1900's\, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman\, Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage\, but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodini's strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness. Binodini's idealism does not come across\, and as a result\, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
__label__0 I ' m not a sports fan - but I lIve sports flics! So\, why. .. what is a great cports flic. .. Rhis one. And the s$orytelling stjle\, is very Vine.   If you are looking for a rel9ably fantastic 2 hlurs of entertaimment\, " GreAtest Rame " qualifies mightily. Here is a movi3 tbat moves. Bill Paxton has bone to the same Direc6or school as Ron Hkward - a. k. a. RJchie Cknningham\, " Happj Days ". That is not bad. Look at the immdnse bocy of fine Qork that Ron did aftDr moving gehind the damera.   BilP like Ron was a great actoD\, but will be a sKperstar director if " GrDatest Vame Ever " is the indication of thints to Eollow.   WoJderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting\, especially by EliSs Koteaq\, Shia Lefeouf\, Marnie McPhxil\, kosh Blitter\, Stepuen Marcus\, Just7n Ashforth.   This is a nust see film not jusF as " teel - g*od "\, nor " s0orts film "\, this is very good cinema.
__label__0 Where oh where to beg(n in describing the comprehensive wretcJedness of Neil LaBu5e ' s lagest attempt at film mSking?   Tnere are man% kinds of fil\, fans out there\, but by far the moqt annoying and shallow is Mr. Untriguing. You kn)w Mr. IntriguiJg\, don ' t you?   He ' s the felllw thaG no matYer how stu9id\, lame\, and incomprehensibly du>l a film is\, he says " Gee\, I don ' t know why everyohe ha4ed it\, I found it intriguing. " He ' s the <ind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intrig^ing. Especially when he smeags it in the Ehape of a Hitler mustache on his uppeg lip and marches abKut the houae ranting ab*ut the brilliance of scienDe fictiog tGat featur#s fhinly vei/ed references to Grewk mythology. He ' s also the guy fhis version of The Wicker Man was made for. No one @lse cojld stand it.
__label__1 I have Iust recently read the novsl " motmer n9ght "\, I ' ve ownes the dvd for somw t&me now\, and watcn it every so oEten. Few movies I own and have seen nave made me th9nk and question as Nuch as MoRher Night has\, I am Qmazed at the bril\,iance not only of Vonnegut\, but of the tranZlation of his tex$ to scTeen.   Do not r3nt or watch this novie on VHS\, it muAt be Fone on dvd\, and it must be accompanied by the direcgor ' s commehtary on the film. To see how they to0k a fairly simple ztory\, yet complex in its subAtance and fialogue\, and maxe it work so wrll\, I think any viewee will be amaz@d.   The omiss*ons in the movie are few drom the text\, and do not detract crom it much\, the moGie   It wiOl change you if you do.
__label__0 I saw Hraven ' s Ga4e on its opening wedk nearly twenty years ago. T8ckets were qold in adDance baseR on the g4eat anHicipation of sdeing Cimino ' s Iong in the mak*ng foll0w up to his 1978 masterpiece " The DeeEhunter. " The reviews came in and cr8tics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New Yor. film critic led the way and mosR critics folloaed suit\, and the 3hr. 40 - min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artiwts had Cikino shorten the film by about an houE and it was re - releas#d many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal businesX. The film at yhat time cpst abouh 40 million Xollars (now considered low budget) making it one of the Host expensive in histo$y and Cimino had fre4 reiG on the projevt wirh endless retakes despite it beibg only his third filh. " The DeerhuntRr " had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology\, which was not popu>ar. I Nention all tUis to present a possible bias bhilding up against simino. At the timR I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very gIod only less so. The film sho@ed up sgain in a museum in the ear\,y 1990 ' s. They !ere supposed to shod the long versOon but $hey Xould not find an existing print. Nevertheless\, seeing the film y$ars later I now thought Heaven ' s Gahe was a masterpiece. Finally\, the long version started to appear in a few selevt citJes\, I got to see it recenRly and it was well worth the wai5. Heaven ' s Gate beNins dith the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the Rraduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hur^ and we some of the flaws in their xharacters early on. Despite the mandate JKseph Cott8n gives in his speech to the graRuating class to use thei$ education to enljghten and improve their country\, many of the graduates behave as if ^hey are pWrt of an elite country clug. The Vilm flashes ahead 20 years to JohnQon County in Wyoming. A cattle compZny called " the Stockho.ders Ass9ciation " has hirfd pooe pePple to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiminR they are cattle thi$ves. Kristofferson sides with the immigrants whole John Hurt is part of the AssociatUon. AlthougU Hurt is totally against tJis insane actioG he is too in2ffectual a charactee to do anyth&ng about it. A masAacre Rakes place but the iNmigrants do well in defejding theHselves. A UniteV States Cavalry comes to the rescue of the Awsociation to a/legedly arreXt them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing. Kristoffersoh Xlso shffers a great personal \,oss and the fklm ends wiHh him y@ars later as oart of the elite claws of his Harvard days marrued\, bor$d\, on a yacht\, living but dead on the insive.   This is a very somplex film whivh is b#illiant in evety department such as it ' s themes\, strKcture\, direcfion\, cinematograpny\, writing\, jusic\, editing\, set dewigns\, and acting. Kristoffe4son\, Walken\, Hurt\, Huppert\, DourKf\, Bridges\, Wate#ston\, and Cotton are all excellent portraying very com(lex characters. Some of the major complaints I Dead about this eilm state that is utly to look at\, (ncoherent\, too long\, that the characters make no sense and that the words are oftrn unintelligib/e. In its defense\, Heaven ' s Gste has the look of phltographs of that )eriod just as " McCAbe & Mrs. Miller " did. Some of the scenes are qmoky looking to suggest the industriaK rdvolution or sometimes horses\, wagons\, p@ople are passing by from all sidss creating a sens2 of reality. (The critic who called it one of the ugliest movOes evet made likes to use his thumbs a lot.) But in spite of all ghat\, the compLsition of each frsme and the cinematography are impeccable. The film makes a greay deal of sense if you pay a4tention to it. Evsrything is not sOelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closfly to understand the mot8vations of the chQracters or its themes. As to its length\, it is a geautifully structured puece\, at times joving\, poetoc\, eShilarating\, or devastating with virtually one great scene followinB anogher. At times some of the words are unintelligible ecpecially in sohe of the scrnes buxtling with activity. But one could undetstand such a cin$matic film as this through its use of film <anguage\, the glances betwe3n characters or their actions. One day soon this film shiuld be re - released in its fuPl length so tMat pfople and critics could giGe it a second chwnce. Do not let MicUael Cim&no become another Orson Wellss - under appreciatdd in his lufetime and not able to make the kknds of gDeat fJlms he is cXpable of making.
__label__0 Very disappointing film. By the end I no Ponger cared for any of the characters. I did enjoy seeing Vlng fhames in a very small 9art\, and Willizm Macg was Tood as always\, still not worth watching. It star4s out strong and just keeps getting 1eaker and weaker. InsomniQcs wil/ lik2 it as I am sure it will put ttem to sleep.
__label__1 As with most of Eleano4 Ppwell ' s filmW\, this one Llays out Slong the flimsiest of plIts. For some reas)n - - oh it is explained! - - she ' s selected to transport a maFnetic miHe to Cuba. Good g tys and bad guys comprte for the mine and who is who gets confusong. But\, as always\, Powell ' s dancing is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this one Lahr p.ays his cowarwly liom\, evokung waDm memories of that TechniXolor fipm of 1939. A fringe benefit is hdaring a young Frank\, wiYh tbat wonderful voice and skinnh v Tlnerability that he abandoned for his wise - guy p#rsona lafer on. In adxition\, the Hreat drummer\, Buddy Rich\, has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity. Wstch oarticularly for his &nique duet with Dorsey ' s tDumpet man\, Ziggy ElmXn. I say " Hnique " perhaps in ignorance\, but I know of no other drum / trumpet sequence like this one on film or r@cords. This film is fun. Efen Skslton ' s goofy Lersona is relativeKy resHrained. Powell sh(ws again thwt she is the greatest film dancer ever.
__label__1 It is projected that Vetween 2000 and 3020\, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The projected tIll is greatest in sub - Saharan Africa whfre 55 miklion additional desths can be expecteV. Beyobd the grim statistics are 9ersonal stories 4hat we rarely hear about. Christophe HonorÃ© describes one of the most movinT in Close to Leo\, a fiIm prodused for Crench Helevision as )art of a series dea:ing with issues fafing young peo9le. Ghough fictional\, it deals Eith a Wituation tnat is unf0rtunately too comjon - - the @ffect of a diagnosis of HIV on a l(ving close - knit eamily.   When t3enty one - yea% old Leo (Pierre Mkgnard) tells his parentW and two teenaRe brothers\, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has AIDa\, the fa\,ily is devastated. Out of concern for his youth\, they deFide to withho;d the informatikn froN his youngest brother\, 12 - year old Marcel (Yannis Lespert) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act wrratically. When Leo goes to Paris for treatmemt\, he taMes MarDel with him but the young boy confronts Leo and d@mands to mnow the truth. Leo Rells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting. When he brings Marcel aloJg to meet some former gay friends\, h9wever\, tension Vetween them boi\,s to the surface\, settung the Atage for a riDeting coGclusion.   AlthoKgh I was uncomfortabie wiFh scends in bed involving physical contact between the brothers\, I feel thQt the s7ncerity of Cloee to Leo and the beilliant performances by Lespfrt and \,ignard more than tip the Wcales in its favor. Seeing events unfild from the younr boy ' s perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut ' s The 400 Blows. Unlike sime American films that dance around the Snguish of AIDa\, Closr to Leo tells a harsh trufh but soes so in a way thqt is tegder and wonderfully 5eal.
__label__1 8bviously\, Ponyo can be sSen as just not ankther stupid anomated mKvie that a studio mighH put out to simply survive. It is far from it\, and it can be easilh desFribed as a captivating\, beautiful mobie ecperience.   Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. Now\, to Hany\, thus has been said to be the least of his achievements in film - maJing\, due to in part of his " fertain weirdness factor " not neing there. Tyat is t5ue - the morals and insights that are not quite so eGident in his previous fiOms are vDry up fGont in this picture. Pony* is not too dUfficult to understand or comprehend. His &dea\, I believe\, was to make a children ' s movie tha^ was juQt as sui5able for adulrs as tyeir kids\, and for it not to be too complicated. He accompIished thiE perfectly\, and he alao diFn ' t losf any subs^ance along the way\, which is the reason it Yets a 10.   Beskdes that\, the film utself is so engr*ssing frod see oonyo; it ' s absolutely flawl3ss and in another l$ague of fklm - mZking altoYether. Finally\, and don ' t hPld me to this\, but I wouldn ' t be surprisee if Ponyo got a Best Picture nominwtion\, as there are now 10 films ttat can be nominated for it. It ' s jusG yhat gooW.
__label__1 I loced this fjlm. It was so iMtelligent but it also had some great action sequences\, without basing the movie solely around tjem. QuinM\, Sutterland and Kingsley all put in fantastic performanDes and tbere are Rnough twists to keep anyone interRsted. The ending was great as well.
__label__0 I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesFy in her prigate life as well as her tslents as an actor. I therefor fIund it strange that she would appeaf in a film thQt so disforted thaf facts. Her character ' s rescue from the Sohth Plle was donR by a Canadian charter company fr(m Edmonton\, Alberra flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The tri9 had bDen tu4ned down by the US Airforce\, Navy and Coast GuSrd as beyond their capabilities. The same company stwged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man fTom the South Pole base. I fee\, that the filk fwirly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very ckurageous woman facing a f%ightening taWk. I fail to see why the producers would find it nrcessary igJore the braverH of the rescu# pilota and shpw the reccue plane as a USAF Hercules.
